AB  - Psychedelic drugs, often referred to as hallucinogens, are quite distinct from
      other classes of psychotropic drugs. Although the subjective and behavioral
      effects they induce are quite dramatic, they possess little addictive potential
      when compared to nicotine, alcohol or opiates. Since the discovery of ketamine
      antidepressant effects, there has been growing interest for these molecules.
      Serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
      are gaining attention as potential treatments for depression and addiction,
      similarly to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), and ibogaine for addiction. Although they possess distinct
      pharmacological profiles, their kinetics of action are quite similar: the
      therapeutic effects are felt within the hours following administration, and last 
      well beyond drug elimination by the organism. This strongly suggests the
      induction of neurogenic and plastic mechanisms, including the involvement of
      trophic factors. This review will explore the literature dealing with the effects
      of psychedelics on neurotrophins, as well as the plastic adaptations that they
      induce, in an attempt to understand their surprising therapeutic potential. We
      will show that although ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics have affinity for 
      very different receptors (NMDA, 5-HT2A), they ultimately initiate similar plastic
      adaptations in the prefrontal cortex through the involvement of the brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We will see that although MDMA uses the same
      receptors as serotonergic psychedelics to alleviate PTSD symptoms, its effect on 
      BDNF levels seem paradoxical and quite different. Finally, we show how ibogaine
      could exert its anti-addictive properties through a completely different
      neurotrophic factor than other psychedelic drugs, the glial cell line-derived
      neurotrophic factor (GDNF). While the current literature concerning the
      psychiatric applications of psychedelic therapy is encouraging, it remains to be 
      determined whether their benefits could be obtained without their psychotomimetic
      effects, or concerns over potential toxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibogaine is a psychoactive indole alkaloid that has been investigated
      for use as a treatment for opioid addiction. While not commercially available in 
      the United States, it is available via Internet suppliers. Ibogaine use has been 
      associated with significant cardiac and neurologic effects, such as QT-segment
      prolongation, cardiac dysrhythmias, hallucinations, seizures, and central nervous
      system depression. We present a case of verified ibogaine exposure with
      associated QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes with qualitative analysis of
      the ingested substance, and examine the history, social context, availability,
      and perceptions of ibogaine's effects and safety. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old
      white woman with medical history significant for heroin and cocaine use disorder 
      presented with reported seizures 1 day after ingestion of 2 g ibogaine powder
      purchased from an Internet supplier. Shortly after ingestion, she experienced
      hallucinations and was reported by family to have four to five seizure-like
      episodes, at one point becoming apneic. In the emergency department, she was
      noted to have QTc prolongation and several episodes of torsade de pointes.
      Qualitative analysis confirmed the presence of ibogaine in the empty foil
      packages containing the ingested substance. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE 
      AWARE OF THIS?: As increasing numbers of opioid-dependent patients attempt to
      curtail their substance use disorders, we anticipate a rise in ibogaine
      exposures, necessitating awareness by front-line clinicians in recognizing and
      treating a drug exposure that can rapidly become life-threatening.

LID - 10.1097/PRA.0000000000000409 [doi]
AB  - The exploration of possible therapeutic benefits of hallucinogenic substances has
      undergone a revitalization in the past decade. This literature review
      investigated the published literature regarding the psychotherapeutic uses of
      hallucinogens in psychiatric disorders. The results showed that a variety of
      substances have been evaluated in the treatment of psychiatric disorders,
      including ayahuasca, ibogaine, ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide,
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and psilocybin. The conditions treated ranged 
      from depression to autism, with the largest volume of research dedicated to
      substance use disorders. The majority of studies that were reviewed demonstrated 
      significant associations with improvement in the conditions investigated.
      However, it was difficult to draw definitive conclusions as most studies suffered
      from small sample sizes, inconsistent measures, and poor study design. To
      properly assess the risks and potential benefits of hallucinogens in psychiatric 
      treatment, there is a need for well designed, standardized studies that
      demonstrate the impact of hallucinogenic substances on psychiatric conditions.

AB  - (-)-Ibogaine and (-)-voacangine are plant derived psychoactives that show promise
      as treatments for opioid addiction. However, these compounds are produced by hard
      to source plants, making these chemicals difficult for broad-scale use. Here we
      report the complete biosynthesis of (-)-voacangine, and de-esterified voacangine,
      which is converted to (-)-ibogaine by heating, enabling biocatalytic production
      of these compounds. Notably, (-)-ibogaine and (-)-voacangine are of the opposite 
      enantiomeric configuration compared to the other major alkaloids found in this
      natural product class. Therefore, this discovery provides insight into
      enantioselective enzymatic formal Diels-Alder reactions.

TI  - Extraction and Conversion Studies of the Antiaddictive Alkaloids Coronaridine,
      Ibogamine, Voacangine, and Ibogaine from Two Mexican Tabernaemontana Species
      (Apocynaceae).
PG  - e1900175
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.201900175 [doi]
AB  - Several species from the Apocynaceae family, such as Tabernanthe iboga, Voacanga 
      africana, and many Tabernaemontana species, produce ibogan type alkaloids, some
      of which present antiaddictive properties. In this study, we used gas
      chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to examine the efficiency of methanol,
      acetone, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, chloroform, and hydrochloric acid in
      extracting the antiaddictive compounds coronaridine, ibogamine, voacangine, and
      ibogaine (altogether the CIVI-complex) from the root barks of Tabernaemontana
      alba and Tabernaemontana arborea. These Mexican species have recently shown great
      potential as alternative natural sources of the aforementioned substances.
      Methanol proved to be the most suitable solvent. Furthermore, the crude
      methanolic extracts could be engaged in a one-step demethoxycarbonylation process
      that converted coronaridine and voacangine directly into its non-carboxylic
      counterparts ibogamine and ibogaine, respectively, without the intermediacy of
      their carboxylic acids. The established protocol straightforwardly simplifies the
      alkaloid mixture from four to two majority compounds. In summary, our findings
      facilitate and improve both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of
      CIVI-complex-containing plant material, as well as outlining a viable method for 
      the bulk production of these scientifically and pharmaceutically important
      substances from Mexican Tabernaemontana species.

      transport.
PG  - 141-145
LID - 10.1038/s41586-019-1135-1 [doi]
AB  - The serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates neurotransmitter homeostasis through
      the sodium- and chloride-dependent recycling of serotonin into presynaptic
      neurons(1-3). Major depression and anxiety disorders are treated using selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors-small molecules that competitively block substrate 
      binding and thereby prolong neurotransmitter action(2,4). The dopamine and
      noradrenaline transporters, together with SERT, are members of the
      neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family. The transport activities of NSSs 
      can be inhibited or modulated by cocaine and amphetamines(2,3), and genetic
      variants of NSSs are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders including
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and bipolar disorder(2,5).
      Studies of bacterial NSS homologues-including LeuT-have shown how their
      transmembrane helices (TMs) undergo conformational changes during the transport
      cycle, exposing a central binding site to either side of the membrane(1,6-12).
      However, the conformational changes associated with transport in NSSs remain
      unknown. To elucidate structure-based mechanisms for transport in SERT we
      investigated its complexes with ibogaine, a hallucinogenic natural product with
      psychoactive and anti-addictive properties(13,14). Notably, ibogaine is a
      non-competitive inhibitor of transport but displays competitive binding towards
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(15,16). Here we report cryo-electron
      microscopy structures of SERT-ibogaine complexes captured in outward-open,
      occluded and inward-open conformations. Ibogaine binds to the central binding
      site, and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMs 1b 
      and 6a. Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hinge-like movement of TM1a 
      and the partial unwinding of TM5, which together create a permeation pathway that
      enables substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm. These structures define the
      structural rearrangements that occur from the outward-open to inward-open
      conformations, and provide insight into the mechanism of neurotransmitter
      transport and ibogaine inhibition.

AB  - The serotonin transporter (SERT), a member of the neurotransmitter:sodium
      symporter family, is responsible for termination of serotonergic signaling by
      re-uptake of serotonin (5-HT) into the presynaptic neuron. Its key role in
      synaptic transmission makes it a major drug target, e.g. for the treatment of
      depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Here, we apply hydrogen-deuterium 
      exchange mass spectrometry to probe the conformational dynamics of human SERT in 
      the absence and presence of known substrates and targeted drugs. Our results
      reveal significant changes in dynamics in regions TM1, EL3, EL4, and TM12 upon
      binding co-transported ions (Na(+)/K(+)) and ligand-mediated changes in TM1, EL3 
      and EL4 upon binding 5-HT, the drugs S-citalopram, cocaine and ibogaine. Our
      results provide a comprehensive direct view of the conformational response of
      SERT upon binding both biologically relevant substrate/ions and ligands of
      pharmaceutical interest, thus advancing our understanding of the
      structure-function relationship in SERT.

TI  - Ibogaine and Subjective Experience: Transformative States and
      Psychopharmacotherapy in the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder.
PG  - 155-165
LID - 10.1080/02791072.2019.1598603 [doi]
AB  - This article examines the therapeutic potential of ibogaine, a powerful oneiric
      alkaloid derived from Tabernanthe iboga, through exploring the subjective
      experiences of 44 participants from two observational treatment studies for
      opioid use disorder. Following treatment with ibogaine HCl, the participants
      (Mexico, n = 30; New Zealand, n = 14) completed the States of Consciousness
      Questionnaire (SCQ) to quantify the magnitude of their psychotropic experience.
      Participants were asked to provide written transcripts of their experiences, with
      those supplied being analyzed thematically through an iterative process, to
      produce a set of coded themes. Mean SCQ scores in many domains exceeded 0.6, the 
      cutoff score for a "complete mystical experience," with 43% of participants
      achieving this in more than five of seven domains. Qualitative data described
      multiple phenomenological themes, including auditory and visual phenomena.
      Ibogaine's strong oneiric action promoted cyclic visions leading to confronting
      realizations involving remorse and regret for participants' actions towards
      others, but also release from feelings of guilt and worthlessness. Many
      participants reported feeling a sense of spiritual transformation. We propose
      that the reported experiences support the meaningfulness of ibogaine's oneiric
      effects as a discrete element in its capacity for healing, which is distinct from
      pharmacological actions associated with reduced withdrawal and craving.

TI  - Ibogaine Administration Modifies GDNF and BDNF Expression in Brain Regions
      Involved in Mesocorticolimbic and Nigral Dopaminergic Circuits.
PG  - 193

AB  - Ibogaine is an atypical psychedelic alkaloid, which has been subject of research 
      due to its reported ability to attenuate drug-seeking behavior. Recent work has
      suggested that ibogaine effects on alcohol self-administration in rats are
      related to the release of Glial cell Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) in the
      Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), a mesencephalic region which hosts the soma of
      dopaminergic neurons. Although previous reports have shown ibogaine's ability to 
      induce GDNF expression in rat midbrain, there are no studies addressing its
      effect on the expression of GDNF and other neurotrophic factors (NFs) such as
      Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) or Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in distinct
      brain regions containing dopaminergic neurons. In this work, we examined the
      effect of ibogaine acute administration on the expression of these NFs in the
      VTA, Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) and the Substantia Nigra
      (SN). Rats were i.p. treated with ibogaine 20 mg/kg (I20), 40 mg/kg (I40) or
      vehicle, and NFs expression was analyzed after 3 and 24 h. At 24 h an increase of
      the expression of the NFs transcripts was observed in a site and dose dependent
      manner. Only for I40, GDNF was selectively upregulated in the VTA and SN. Both
      doses elicited a large increase in the expression of BDNF transcripts in the
      NAcc, SN and PFC, while in the VTA a significant effect was found only for I40.
      Finally, NGF mRNA was upregulated in all regions after I40, while I20 showed a
      selective upregulation in PFC and VTA. Regarding protein levels, an increase of
      GDNF was observed in the VTA only for I40 but no significant increase for BDNF
      was found in all the studied areas. Interestingly, an increase of proBDNF was
      detected in the NAcc for both doses. These results show for the first time a
      selective increase of GDNF specifically in the VTA for I40 but not for I20 after 
      24 h of administration, which agrees with the effective dose found in previous
      self-administration studies in rodents. Further research is needed to understand 
      the contribution of these changes to ibogaine's ability to attenuate drug-seeking
      behavior.

AB  - The serotonin transporter (SERT) belongs to the monoamine transporter family,
      which also includes the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. SERT is
      essential for regulating serotonergic signaling by the reuptake of serotonin from
      the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron. Dysregulation of SERT has
      been implicated in several major psychiatric disorders such as major depressive
      disorder (MDD). MDD was among the top five leading causes of years lived with
      disease in 2016 and is characterized as a major global burden. Several drugs have
      been developed to target SERT for use in the treatment of MDD, and their
      respective binding modes and locations within SERT have been studied. The
      elucidation of the first structure of a bacterial SERT homologue in 2005 has
      accelerated crystallographic, computational, and functional studies to further
      elucidate drug binding and method of action in SERT. Herein, we aim to highlight 
      and compare these studies with an emphasis on what the different experimental
      methods conclude on substrate and inhibitor binding modes, and the potential
      caveats of using the different types of studies are discussed. We focus this
      review on the binding of cognate substrate and drugs belonging to the different
      families of antidepressants, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and 
      multimodal drugs, as well as illicit drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, and
      ibogaine. This article is part of the issue entitled 'Special Issue on
      Neurotransmitter Transporters'.

TI  - Morphing of Ibogaine: A Successful Attempt into the Search for Sigma-2 Receptor
      Ligands.
LID - E488 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms20030488 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine is a psychoactive indole alkaloid with high affinity for several targets
      including the sigma(2) receptor. Indeed, extensive data support the involvement
      of the sigma(2) receptor in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's
      disease, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse and pain. Due to its serious side effects
      which prevent ibogaine from potential clinical applications, novel ibogaine
      derivatives endowed with improved sigma(2) receptor affinity may be particularly 
      beneficial. With the purpose to facilitate the investigation of iboga alkaloid
      derivatives which may serve as templates for the design of selective sigma(2)
      receptor ligands, here we report a deconstruction study on the ibogaine tricyclic
      moiety and a successive scaffold-hopping of the indole counterpart. A 3D-QSAR
      model has been applied to predict the sigma(2) pKi values of the new compounds,
      whereas a molecular docking study conducted upon the sigma(2) receptor built by
      homology modeling was used to further validate the best-scored molecules. We
      eventually evaluated pinoline, a carboline derivative, for sigma(2) receptor
      affinity through radioligand binding assay and the results confirmed the
      predicted high microM range of affinity and good selectivity. The obtained
      results could be helpful in the drug design process of new ibogaine simplified
      analogs with improved sigma(2) receptor binding capabilities.

      Treatment.
PG  - 85-92
LID - 10.1080/02791072.2018.1564157 [doi]
AB  - This article outlines a liberation-focused model of addiction treatment. Drawing 
      on the Latin root word "addictus", addiction is seen as slavery and freedom,
      rather than the cessation of drug and alcohol use, is proposed as a viable,
      alternative treatment goal. Freedom is defined as: (1) the capacity to create a
      life of social and internal complexity and multiplicity; (2) the ability to make 
      choices from an array of options; and (3) the possibility of engaging in
      long-term, goal-directed behavior. This vision of personal liberation is then
      embedded within a biopsychosocial model of care and treatment. Examples of how
      biomedical, psychological, and social interventions can each serve to promote the
      goal and experience of freedom and liberation are provided. Engaging in identity 
      projects and using harm reduction interventions and philosophies are also seen as
      key to this transformative journey.

TI  - Metabolite Profiling of Anti-Addictive Alkaloids from Four Mexican
      Tabernaemontana Species and the Entheogenic African Shrub Tabernanthe iboga
      (Apocynaceae).
PG  - e1800506
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.201800506 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine and other ibogan type alkaloids present anti-addictive effects against
      several drugs of abuse and occur in different species of the Apocynaceae family. 
      In this work, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and principal 
      component analysis (PCA) in order to compare the alkaloid profiles of the root
      and stem barks of four Mexican Tabernaemontana species with the root bark of the 
      entheogenic African shrub Tabernanthe iboga. PCA demonstrated that separation
      between species could be attributed to quantitative differences of the major
      alkaloids, coronaridine, ibogamine, voacangine, and ibogaine. While T. iboga
      mainly presented high concentrations of ibogaine, Tabernaemontana samples either 
      showed a predominance of voacangine and ibogaine, or coronaridine and ibogamine, 
      respectively. The results illustrate the phytochemical proximity between both
      genera and confirm previous suggestions that Mexican Tabernaemontana species are 
      viable sources of anti-addictive compounds.

TI  - Phytochemical characterization of Tabernanthe iboga root bark and its effects on 
      dysfunctional metabolism and cognitive performance in high-fat-fed C57BL/6J mice.
PG  - 111-123
LID - 10.31665/JFB.2018.3154 [doi]
AB  - Preparations of the root bark of Tabernanthe iboga have long been used in Central
      and West African traditional medicine to combat fatigue, as a neuro-stimulant in 
      rituals, and for treatment of diabetes. The principal alkaloid of T. iboga,
      ibogaine, has attracted attention in many countries around the world for
      providing relief for opioid craving in drug addicts. Using a plant metabolomics
      approach, we detected five phenolic compounds, including 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid,
      and 30 alkaloids, seven of which were previously reported from T. iboga root
      bark. Following a report that iboga extracts contain insulinotropic agents, we
      aimed to determine the potential alleviating effects of the water extract of
      iboga root bark on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperglycemia as well as its
      effects on cognitive function in male C57BL/6J mice. Feeding a HFD to mice for 10
      weeks produced manifestations of metabolic syndrome such as increased body weight
      and increased plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, insulin, leptin, and pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, MCP-1,
      ICAM-1), as compared to mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD). Supplementation of HFD
      with iboga extract at ibogaine doses of 0.83 (low) and 2.07 (high) mg/kg/day did 
      not improve these HFD-induced metabolic effects except for a reduction of plasma 
      MCP-1 in the low dose group, indicative of an anti-inflammatory effect. When the 
      HFD mice were tested in the water maze, the high-dose iboga extract caused
      hippocampus-dependent impairments in spatial learning and memory, as compared to 
      mice receiving only a HFD.

AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid found in the root bark of the Iboga shrub native
      to west Africa possessing hallucinogenic properties. For centuries it has been
      used in religious ceremonies and to gain spiritual enlightenment. However, since 
      the early 1960s, its apparent ability to reduce craving for psychoactive
      substances including alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates, and nicotine has
      led to its use in detoxification treatments. In many instances, clients receive
      treatment in non-medical settings, with little by way of robust scientific
      clinical trials. This chapter provides an overview of the potential benefits that
      could arise from such research. This is balanced against the serious adverse
      effects that can occur due to undiagnosed health conditions and/or concomitant
      use of other drugs. A detailed update is provided of the 33 deaths known to have 
      occurred, including 5 in the UK. Looking forward, there is a need to develop
      better opiate detoxification treatment against a background of increasing
      opioid-related fatalities. A congener of ibogaine, 18-MC, appears to be safer and
      is to undergo clinical trials. In the meantime, would-be consumers and treatment 
      providers must make more careful, detailed risk-assessments before using
      ibogaine. Treatment outcomes, including deaths, need to be accurately recorded
      and published.

AB  - Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid and dissociative psychedelic that
      demonstrates anti-addictive properties with several substances of abuse,
      including alcohol. 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a naturally
      occurring psychedelic known to occasion potent mystical-type experiences and also
      demonstrates anti-addictive properties. The potential therapeutic effects of both
      compounds in treating alcohol use disorder require further investigation and
      there are no published human neuroimaging findings of either treatment to date.
      We present the case of a 31-year-old male military veteran with moderate alcohol 
      use disorder who sought treatment at an inpatient clinic in Mexico that utilized 
      a sequential protocol with ibogaine hydrochloride (1550mg, 17.9mg/kg) on day 1,
      followed by vaporized 5-MeO-DMT (bufotoxin source 50mg, estimated 5-MeO-DMT
      content, 5-7mg) on day 3. The patient received SPECT neuroimaging that included a
      resting-state protocol before, and 3 days after completion of the program. During
      the patient's ibogaine treatment, he experienced dream-like visions that included
      content pertaining to his alcohol use and resolution of past developmental
      traumas. He described his treatment with 5-MeO-DMT as a peak transformational and
      spiritual breakthrough. On post-treatment SPECT neuroimaging, increases in brain 
      perfusion were noted in bilateral caudate nuclei, left putamen, right insula, as 
      well as temporal, occipital, and cerebellar regions compared to the patient's
      baseline scan. The patient reported improvement in mood, cessation of alcohol
      use, and reduced cravings at 5 days post-treatment, effects which were sustained 
      at 1 month, with a partial return to mild alcohol use at 2 months. In this case, 
      serial administration of ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT resulted in increased perfusion
      in multiple brain regions broadly associated with alcohol use disorders and known
      pharmacology of both compounds, which coincided with a short-term therapeutic
      outcome. We present theoretical considerations regarding the potential of both
      psychedelic medicines in treating alcohol use disorders in the context of these
      isolated findings, and areas for future investigation.

      consumption: Short- and long-term outcomes and current psychological functioning.
PG  - 65-73

AB  - Background and aims: Very few studies have reported the effectiveness of ibogaine
      as a treatment for chronic opioid use. Therefore, this study evaluated the acute 
      subjective effects of ibogaine, outcomes on problematic opioid consumption, and
      the long-term associations with psychological functioning. Methods: Using online 
      data collection, 88 patients who received ibogaine treatment in Mexico between
      2012 and 2015 completed our survey. Results: Most participants (72%) had used
      opioids for at least 4 years and 69% reported daily use. Most (80%) indicated
      that ibogaine eliminated or drastically reduced withdrawal symptoms. Fifty
      percent reported that ibogaine reduced opioid craving, some (25%) reporting a
      reduction in craving lasting at least 3 months. Thirty percent of participants
      reported never using opioids again following ibogaine treatment. And over one
      half (54%) of these abstainers had been abstinent for at least 1 year, with 31%
      abstinent for at least 2 years. At the time of survey, 41% of all participants
      reported sustained abstinence (>6 months). Although 70% of the total sample
      reported a relapse following treatment, 48% reported decreased use from
      pretreatment levels and an additional 11% eventually achieved abstinence.
      Treatment responders had the lowest rates of depressive and anxious symptoms, the
      highest levels of subjective well-being and rated their ibogaine treatment as
      more spiritually meaningful compared with treatment non-responders. Conclusion:
      The results suggest that ibogaine is associated with reductions in opioid use,
      including complete abstinence, and has long-term positive psychological outcomes.
      Future research should investigate the efficacy of ibogaine treatment using
      rigorous longitudinal and controlled designs.

PG  - 2475-2483

AB  - The West African iboga plant has been used for centuries by the Bwiti and Mbiri
      tribes to induce hallucinations during religious ceremonies. Ibogaine, the
      principal alkaloid responsible for iboga's psychedelic properties, was isolated
      and sold as an antidepressant in France for decades before its adverse effects
      precipitated its removal from the market. An ibogaine resurgence in the 1960s was
      driven by U.S. heroin addicts who claimed that ibogaine cured their opiate
      addictions. Behavioral pharmacologic studies in animal models provided evidence
      that ibogaine could blunt self-administration of not only opiates but cocaine,
      amphetamines, and nicotine. Ibogaine displays moderate-to-weak affinities for a
      wide spectrum of receptor and transporter proteins; recent work suggests that its
      actions at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes may underlie its reputed
      antiopiate effects. At micromolar levels, ibogaine is neurotoxic and cardiotoxic 
      and has been linked to several deaths by cardiac arrest. Structure-activity
      studies led to the isolation of the ibogaine analog 18-methoxycoronaridine
      (18-MC), an alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptor modulator that retains ibogaine's
      anticraving properties with few or no adverse effects. Clinical trials of 18-MC
      treatment of nicotine addiction are pending. Ibogaine analogs may also hold
      promise for treating anxiety and depression via the "psychedelic-assisted
      therapy" approach that employs hallucinogens including psilocybin and
      methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("ecstasy").

AB  - Ibogaine is a psychoactive herbal medication with alleged antiaddiction
      properties. We report a case of ibogaine intoxication mimicking Long-QT syndrome 
      resulting in ventricular flutter and nearby cardiac arrest. A 61-year-old man
      experienced massive QT prolongation and ventricular flutter at a rate of 270
      beats per minute requiring defibrillation after ingestion of a large dose of
      Ibogaine. The ingested dose of 65-70 mg/kg represents the highest survived
      ibogaine dose reported to date. As a result of the long plasma half-life of
      ibogaine, it took 7 days for the patient's QT interval to normalize.

TI  - Wastewater-based epidemiology in low Human Development Index states: bias in
      consumption monitoring of illicit drugs.
PG  - 27819-27838
LID - 10.1007/s11356-018-2864-7 [doi]
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology is a promising approach worldwide, and its
      application is currently being developed in non-advanced economies. This
      technology, based on known toxicokinetic data initially used to detect illicit
      drugs in well-managed and maintained local sewer networks, has been extended to
      assess other products such as pesticides, alcohol, flame retardants, nicotine,
      and other substances. This technology is also used in countries with non-advanced
      economies. The present review aims to support future wastewater-based
      epidemiology in such countries by providing toxicokinetic data for locally used
      narcotic drugs that are expected or known to be emerging in developed countries, 
      outlining the excretion differences due to human polymorphism, and summarising
      the practical obstacles due to the coverage, maintenance efficiency, or type of
      local sewage network.Case study feedback from Martinique is presented as an
      example; the Martinique field study complies with the Organisation for Economic
      Co-operation and Development standards for health issues, but not with regard to 
      population and urban dynamics.

AB  - Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are a large ( approximately 3000 members) and
      structurally diverse class of metabolites restricted to a limited number of plant
      families in the order Gentianales. Tabernanthe iboga or iboga (Apocynaceae) is
      native to western equatorial Africa and has been used in traditional medicine for
      centuries. Howard Lotsof is credited with bringing iboga to the attention of
      Western medicine through his accidental discovery that iboga can alleviate opioid
      withdrawal symptoms. Since this observation, iboga has been investigated for its 
      use in the general management of addiction. We were interested in elucidating
      ibogaine biosynthesis to understand the unique reaction steps en route to
      ibogaine. Furthermore, because ibogaine is currently sourced from plant material,
      these studies may help improve the ibogaine supply chain through synthetic
      biology approaches. Here, we used next-generation sequencing to generate the
      first iboga transcriptome and leveraged homology-guided gene discovery to
      identify the penultimate hydroxylase and final O-methyltransferase steps in
      ibogaine biosynthesis, herein named ibogamine 10-hydroxylase (I10H) and
      noribogaine-10-O-methyltransferase (N10OMT). Heterologous expression in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae (I10H) or Escherichia coli (N10OMT) and incubation with 
      putative precursors, along with HPLC-MS analysis, confirmed the predicted
      activities of both enzymes. Moreover, high expression levels of their transcripts
      were detected in ibogaine-accumulating plant tissues. These discoveries coupled
      with our publicly available iboga transcriptome will contribute to additional
      gene discovery efforts and could lead to the stabilization of the global ibogaine
      supply chain and to the development of ibogaine as a treatment for addiction.

AB  - Mental disorders are rising while development of novel psychiatric medications is
      declining. This stall in innovation has also been linked with intense debates on 
      the current diagnostics and explanations for mental disorders, together
      constituting a paradigmatic crisis. A radical innovation is psychedelic-assisted 
      psychotherapy (PAP): professionally supervised use of ketamine, MDMA, psilocybin,
      LSD and ibogaine as part of elaborated psychotherapy programs. Clinical results
      so far have shown safety and efficacy, even for "treatment resistant" conditions,
      and thus deserve increasing attention from medical, psychological and psychiatric
      professionals. But more than novel treatments, the PAP model also has important
      consequences for the diagnostics and explanation axis of the psychiatric crisis, 
      challenging the discrete nosological entities and advancing novel explanations
      for mental disorders and their treatment, in a model considerate of social and
      cultural factors, including adversities, trauma, and the therapeutic potential of
      some non-ordinary states of consciousness.

TI  - A Mixed-Method Analysis of Persisting Effects Associated with Positive Outcomes
      Following Ibogaine Detoxification.
PG  - 287-297
LID - 10.1080/02791072.2018.1487607 [doi]
AB  - We examined persisting effects, self-perceived challenges, and potential benefits
      associated with positive outcomes following ibogaine detoxification using data
      collected as part of a larger online retrospective study of 73 patients who
      received treatment for chronic opioid use in Mexico between 2012 and 2015. A
      mixed-methods design was used comparing treatment responders versus
      non-responders, as well as content coding of themes from open-ended questions.
      Most participants reported positive persisting effects of ibogaine detoxification
      (e.g., enhanced personal sense of gratitude and authenticity, and meaning and
      appreciation for life). Compared to non-responders, treatment responders endorsed
      greater persisting changes in their ability to tolerate difficult/painful
      feelings, capacity for coping with stress, and reduced unhealthy anger. Treatment
      responders reported greater change in subjective levels of inner peace, joy,
      feelings of love/openheartedness, and experiences of sacredness in life.
      Qualitative analyses revealed that treatment responders reported a heightened
      sense of spiritual awareness and greater connection to their intra-/interpersonal
      relationships after ibogaine detoxification. Notable challenges of ibogaine
      detoxification included psychological and health-related difficulties during
      treatment and challenges with post-treatment integration. Findings highlight the 
      persisting effects associated with positive response to ibogaine detoxification
      and possible post-treatment needs (i.e., more integration/aftercare resources).
      Future research using rigorous experimental designs is needed.

AB  - Two monoterpenoid indole alkaloid erchinines A (1) and B (2), possessing unique
      1,4-diazepine fused with oxazolidine architecture and three hemiaminals, were
      isolated from Ervatamia chinensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis 
      of intensive spectroscopic analysis, and a plausible biosynthetic pathway from
      ibogaine was proposed. Both compounds exhibited significant antimicrobial
      activity against Trichophyton rubrum and Bacillus subtilis, and their activities 
      were comparable to the first line antifungal drug griseofulvin and antibiotic
      cefotaxime.

TI  - Ibogaine Detoxification Transitions Opioid and Cocaine Abusers Between Dependence
      and Abstinence: Clinical Observations and Treatment Outcomes.
PG  - 529
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2018.00529 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine may be effective for transitioning opioid and cocaine dependent
      individuals to sobriety. American and European self-help groups provided public
      testimonials that ibogaine alleviated drug craving and opioid withdrawal symptoms
      after only a single dose administration. Preclinical studies in animal models of 
      addiction have provided proof-of-concept evidence in support of these claims.
      However, the purported therapeutic benefits of ibogaine are based on anecdotal
      reports from a small series of case reports that used retrospective recruitment
      procedures. We reviewed clinical results from an open label case series (N = 191)
      of human volunteers seeking to detoxify from opioids or cocaine with medical
      monitoring during inpatient treatment. Whole blood was assayed to obtain
      pharmacokinetic measures to determine the metabolism and clearance of ibogaine.
      Clinical safety data and adverse events (AEs) were studied in male and female
      subjects. There were no significant adverse events following administration of
      ibogaine in a dose range that was shown to be effective for blocking opioid
      withdrawal symptoms in this study. We used multi-dimensional craving
      questionnaires during inpatient detoxification to test if ibogaine was effective 
      in diminishing heroin and cocaine cravings. Participants also completed
      standardized questionnaires about their health and mood before and after ibogaine
      treatment, and at program discharge. One-month follow-up data were reviewed where
      available to determine if ibogaine's effects on drug craving would persist
      outside of an inpatient setting. We report here that ibogaine therapy
      administered in a safe dose range diminishes opioid withdrawal symptoms and
      reduces drug cravings. Pharmacological treatments for opioid dependence include
      detoxification, narcotic antagonists and long-term opioid maintenance therapy.
      Our results support product development of single oral dose administration of
      ibogaine for the treatment of opioid withdrawal during medically supervised
      detoxification to transition drug dependent individuals to abstinence.

TI  - Ibogaine Acute Administration in Rats Promotes Wakefulness, Long-Lasting REM
      Sleep Suppression, and a Distinctive Motor Profile.
PG  - 374
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2018.00374 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine is a potent psychedelic alkaloid that has been the focus of intense
      research because of its intriguing anti-addictive properties. According to
      anecdotic reports, ibogaine has been originally classified as an oneirogenic
      psychedelic; i.e., induces a dream-like cognitive activity while awake. However, 
      the effects of ibogaine administration on wakefulness (W) and sleep have not been
      thoroughly assessed. The main aim of our study was to characterize the acute
      effects of ibogaine administration on W and sleep. For this purpose,
      polysomnographic recordings on chronically prepared rats were performed in the
      light phase during 6 h. Animals were treated with ibogaine (20 and 40 mg/kg) or
      vehicle, immediately before the beginning of the recordings. Furthermore, in
      order to evaluate associated motor behaviors during the W period, a different
      group of animals was tested for 2 h after ibogaine treatment on an open field
      with video-tracking software. Compared to control, animals treated with ibogaine 
      showed an increase in time spent in W. This effect was accompanied by a decrease 
      in slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movements (REM) sleep time. REM sleep
      latency was significantly increased in animals treated with the higher ibogaine
      dose. While the effects on W and SWS were observed during the first 2 h of
      recordings, the decrement in REM sleep time was observed throughout the recording
      time. Accordingly, ibogaine treatment with the lower dose promoted an increase on
      locomotion, while tremor and flat body posture were observed only with the higher
      dose in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, head shake response, a behavior
      which has been associated in rats with the 5HT2A receptor activation by
      hallucinogens, was not modified. We conclude that ibogaine promotes a waking
      state that is accompanied by a robust and long-lasting REM sleep suppression. In 
      addition, it produces a dose-dependent unusual motor profile along with other
      serotonin-related behaviors. Since ibogaine is metabolized to produce
      noribogaine, further experiments are needed to elucidate if the metabolite and/or
      the parent drug produced these effects.

      Detoxification Utilizing Ibogaine.

LID - 10.1080/02791072.2018.1447175 [doi]
AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is currently an epidemic in the United States (US) and 
      ibogaine is reported to have the ability to interrupt opioid addiction by
      simultaneously mitigating withdrawal and craving symptoms. This study examined
      opioid withdrawal and drug craving scores in 50 participants with OUD undergoing 
      a week-long detoxification treatment protocol with ibogaine. The Addiction
      Severity Index (ASI) was used for baseline characterization of participants' OUD.
      Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale
      (SOWS), and Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS) scores were collected at 48 and 
      24 hours prior to ibogaine administration, as well as 24 and 48 hours after
      ibogaine administration. At 48 hours following ibogaine administration,
      withdrawal and craving scores were significantly lowered in comparison to
      baseline: 78% of patients did not exhibit objective clinical signs of opioid
      withdrawal, 79% reported minimal cravings for opioids, and 68% reported
      subjective withdrawal symptoms in the mild range. Ibogaine appears to facilitate 
      opioid detoxification by reducing opioid withdrawal and craving in participants
      with OUD. These results warrant further research using rigorous controlled
      trials.

TI  - The Effects of Ibogaine on Uterine Smooth Muscle Contractions: Relation to the
      Activity of Antioxidant Enzymes.
PG  - 5969486
LID - 10.1155/2018/5969486 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid originally extracted from the root bark of the
      African rainforest shrub Tabernanthe iboga. It has been explored as a treatment
      for substance abuse because it interrupts drug addiction and relieves withdrawal 
      symptoms. However, it has been shown that ibogaine treatment leads to a sharp and
      transient fall in cellular ATP level followed by an increase of cellular
      respiration and ROS production. Since contractile tissues are sensitive to
      changes in the levels of ATP and ROS, here we investigated an ibogaine-mediated
      link between altered redox homeostasis and uterine contractile activity. We found
      that low concentrations of ibogaine stimulated contractile activity in
      spontaneously active uteri, but incremental increase of doses inhibited it.
      Inhibitory concentrations of ibogaine led to decreased SOD1 and elevated GSH-Px
      activity, but doses that completely inhibited contractions increased CAT
      activity. Western blot analyses showed that changes in enzyme activities were not
      due to elevated enzyme protein concentrations but posttranslational
      modifications. Changes in antioxidant enzyme activities point to a vast
      concentration-dependent increase in H2O2 level. Knowing that extracellular ATP
      stimulates isolated uterus contractility, while H2O2 has an inhibitory effect,
      this concentration-dependent stimulation/inhibition could be linked to
      ibogaine-related alterations in ATP level and redox homeostasis.

AB  - In contrast to plasma membrane-expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
      (nAChRs), mitochondrial nAChRs function in an ion-independent manner by
      triggering intra-mitochondrial kinases that regulate the release of cytochrome c 
      (Cyt c), an important step in cellular apoptosis. The aim of this study is to
      determine the structural requirements for mitochondrial alpha3beta4* nAChR
      activation by measuring the modulatory effects of two noncompetitive antagonists 
      of these receptors, (+)-catharanthine and (+/-)-18-methoxycoronaridine
      [(+/-)-18-MC], on Cyt c release from wild-type and alpha7-/- mice mitochondria.
      The sandwich ELISA results indicated that alpha3beta4* nAChRs are present in
      liver mitochondria in higher amounts compared to that in brain mitochondria and
      that these receptors are up-regulated in alpha7-/- mice. Correspondingly,
      (+/-)-18-MC decreased Cyt c release from liver mitochondria of wild-type mice and
      from brain and liver mitochondria of alpha7-/- mice. The effect in wild-type mice
      mitochondria was mediated mainly by the Src-dependent pathway, regulating the
      apoptogenic activity of reactive oxygen species, while in alpha7-/- mice
      mitochondria, (+/-)-18-MC strongly affected the calcium-calmodulin kinase
      II-dependent pathway. In contrast, (+)-catharanthine was much less potent than
      (+/-)-18-MC and triggered several signaling pathways, suggesting the involvement 
      of multiple nAChR subtypes. These results show for the first time that
      noncompetitive antagonists can induce mitochondrial alpha3beta4* nAChR signaling,
      giving a more comprehensive understanding on the function of intracellular nAChR 
      subtypes.

AB  - The human genome encodes 19 genes of the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) family;
      non-synonymous changes in the coding sequence give rise to mutated transporters, 
      which are misfolded and thus cause diseases in the affected individuals.
      Prominent examples include mutations in the transporters for dopamine (DAT,
      SLC6A3), for creatine (CT1, SLC6A8), and for glycine (GlyT2, SLC6A5), which
      result in infantile dystonia, mental retardation, and hyperekplexia,
      respectively. Thus, there is an obvious unmet medical need to identify compounds,
      which can remedy the folding deficit. The pharmacological correction of folding
      defects was originally explored in mutants of the serotonin transporter (SERT,
      SLC6A4), which were created to study the COPII-dependent export from the
      endoplasmic reticulum. This led to the serendipitous discovery of the
      pharmacochaperoning action of ibogaine. Ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine
      also rescue several disease-relevant mutants of DAT. Because the pharmacology of 
      DAT and SERT is exceptionally rich, it is not surprising that additional
      compounds have been identified, which rescue folding-deficient mutants. These
      compounds are not only of interest for restoring DAT function in the affected
      children. They are also likely to serve as useful tools to interrogate the
      folding trajectory of the transporter. This is likely to initiate a virtuous
      cycle: if the principles underlying folding of SLC6 transporters are understood, 
      the design of pharmacochaperones ought to be facilitated.

AB  - The inhibitory activity of coronaridine congeners on human (h) alpha4beta2 and
      alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) is determined by Ca(2+) influx
      assays, whereas their effects on neurons in the ventral inferior (VI) aspect of
      the mouse medial habenula (MHb) are determined by patch-clamp recordings. The
      Ca(2+) influx results clearly establish that coronaridine congeners inhibit
      halpha3beta4 AChRs with higher selectivity compared to halpha4beta2 and halpha7
      subtypes, and with the following potency sequence, for halpha4beta2:
      (+/-)-18-methoxycoronaridine
      [(+/-)-18-MC]>(+)-catharanthine>(+/-)-18-methylaminocoronaridine [(+/-)-18-MAC]
      approximately (+/-)-18-hydroxycoronaridine [(+/-)-18-HC]; and for halpha7:
      (+)-catharanthine>(+/-)-18-MC>(+/-)-18-HC>(+/-)-18-MAC. Interestingly, the
      inhibitory potency of (+)-catharanthine (27+/-4muM) and (+/-)-18-MC (28+/-6muM)
      on MHb (VI) neurons was lower than that observed on halpha3beta4 AChRs,
      suggesting that these compounds inhibit a variety of endogenous alpha3beta4*
      AChRs. In addition, the interaction of bupropion with (-)-ibogaine sites on
      halpha3beta4 AChRs is tested by [(3)H]ibogaine competition binding experiments.
      The results indicate that bupropion binds to ibogaine sites at desensitized
      halpha3beta4 AChRs with 2-fold higher affinity than at resting receptors,
      suggesting that these compounds share the same binding sites. In conclusion,
      coronaridine congeners inhibit halpha3beta4 AChRs with higher selectivity
      compared to other AChRs, by interacting with the bupropion (luminal) site.
      Coronaridine congeners also inhibit alpha3beta4*AChRs expressed in MHb (VI)
      neurons, supporting the notion that these receptors are important endogenous
      targets for their anti-addictive activities.

AB  - Point mutations in the gene encoding the human dopamine transporter (hDAT,
      SLC6A3) cause a syndrome of infantile/juvenile dystonia and parkinsonism. To
      unravel the molecular mechanism underlying these disorders and investigate
      possible pharmacological therapies, here we examined 13 disease-causing DAT
      mutants that were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when heterologously
      expressed in HEK293 cells. In three of these mutants, i.e. hDAT-V158F,
      hDAT-G327R, and hDAT-L368Q, the folding deficit was remedied with the
      pharmacochaperone noribogaine or the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) inhibitor
      pifithrin-mu such that endoplasmic reticulum export of and radioligand binding
      and substrate uptake by these DAT mutants were restored. In Drosophila
      melanogaster, DAT deficiency results in reduced sleep. We therefore exploited the
      power of targeted transgene expression of mutant hDAT in Drosophila to explore
      whether these hDAT mutants could also be pharmacologically rescued in an intact
      organism. Noribogaine or pifithrin-mu treatment supported hDAT delivery to the
      presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons and restored sleep to normal length
      in DAT-deficient (fumin) Drosophila lines expressing hDAT-V158F or hDAT-G327R. In
      contrast, expression of hDAT-L368Q in the Drosophila DAT mutant background caused
      developmental lethality, indicating a toxic action not remedied by
      pharmacochaperoning. Our observations identified those mutations most likely
      amenable to pharmacological rescue in the affected children. In addition, our
      findings also highlight the challenges of translating insights from
      pharmacochaperoning in cell culture to the clinical situation. Because of the
      evolutionary conservation in dopaminergic neurotransmission between Drosophila
      and people, pharmacochaperoning of DAT in D. melanogaster may allow us to bridge 
      that gap.

      outcomes.
PG  - 24-36

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibogaine is a monoterpene indole alkaloid used in medical and
      nonmedical settings for the treatment of opioid use disorder. Its mechanism of
      action is apparently novel. There are no published prospective studies of drug
      use outcomes with ibogaine. OBJECTIVES: To study outcomes following opioid
      detoxification with ibogaine. METHODS: In this observational study, 30 subjects
      with DSM-IV Opioid Dependence (25 males, 5 females) received a mean total dose of
      1,540 +/- 920 mg ibogaine HCl. Subjects used oxycodone (n = 21; 70%) and/or
      heroin (n = 18; 60%) in respective amounts of 250 +/- 180 mg/day and 1.3 +/- 0.94
      g/day, and averaged 3.1 +/- 2.6 previous episodes of treatment for opioid
      dependence. Detoxification and follow-up outcomes at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      were evaluated utilizing the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) and
      Addiction Severity Index Composite (ASIC) scores, respectively. RESULTS: SOWS
      scores decreased from 31.0 +/- 11.6 pretreatment to 14.0 +/- 9.8 at 76.5 +/- 30
      hours posttreatment (t = 7.07, df = 26, p < 0.001). At 1-month posttreatment
      follow-up, 15 subjects (50%) reported no opioid use during the previous 30 days. 
      ASIC Drug Use and Legal and Family/Social Status scores were improved relative to
      pretreatment baseline at all posttreatment time points (p < .001). Improvement in
      Drug Use scores was maximal at 1 month, and subsequently sustained from 3 to 12
      months at levels that did not reach equivalence to the effect at 1 month.
      CONCLUSION: Ibogaine was associated with substantive effects on opioid withdrawal
      symptoms and drug use in subjects for whom other treatments had been
      unsuccessful, and may provide a useful prototype for discovery and development of
      innovative pharmacotherapy of addiction.

PG  - 600-602
LID - 10.1080/15563650.2017.1287372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibogaine is an agent that has been evaluated as an unapproved
      anti-addictive agent for the management of drug dependence. Sudden cardiac death 
      has been described to occur secondary to its use. We describe the clinical
      effects and toxicokinetics of ibogaine and noribogaine in a single patient. For
      this purpose, we developed a LC-MS/MS-method to measure ibogaine and noribogaine 
      plasma-concentrations. We used two compartments with first order absorption. CASE
      DETAILS: The maximum concentration of ibogaine was 1.45 mg/L. Our patient
      developed markedly prolonged QTc interval of 647ms maximum, several multiple
      cardiac arrhythmias (i.e., atrial tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia and
      Torsades des Pointes). QTc-prolongation remained present until 12 days after
      ingestion, several days after ibogaine plasma-levels were low, implicating
      clinically relevant noribogaine concentrations long after ibogaine had been
      cleared from the plasma. The ratio k12/k21 for noribogaine was 21.5 and 4.28 for 
      ibogaine, implicating a lower distribution of noribogaine from the peripheral
      compartment into the central compartment compared to ibogaine. CONCLUSIONS: We
      demonstrated a linear relationship between the concentration of the metabolite
      and long duration of action, rather than with parent ibogaine. Therefore, after
      (prolonged) ibogaine ingestion, clinicians should beware of long-term effects due
      to its metabolite.

AB  - Indole alkaloids possess a large spectrum of biological activities including
      anti-protozoal action. Here we report for the first time that voacamine, isolated
      from the plant Tabernaemontana coronaria, is an antiprotozoal agent effective
      against a large array of trypanosomatid parasites including Indian strain of
      Leishmania donovani and Brazilian strains of Leishmania amazonensis and
      Trypanosoma cruzi. It inhibits the relaxation activity of topoisomerase IB of L. 
      donovani (LdTop1B) and stabilizes the cleavable complex. Voacamine is probably
      the first LdTop1B-specific poison to act uncompetitively. It has no impact on
      human topoisomerase I and II up to 200muM concentrations. The study also provides
      a thorough insight into ultrastructural alterations induced in three
      kinetoplastid parasites by a specific inhibitor of LdTop1B. Voacamine is also
      effective against intracellular amastigotes of different drug unresponsive field 
      isolates of Leishmania donovani obtained from endemic zones of India severely
      affected with visceral leishmaniasis. Most importantly, this is the first report 
      demonstrating the efficacy of a compound to reduce the burden of drug resistant
      parasites, unresponsive to SAG, amphotericin B and miltefosine, in experimental
      BALB/c mice model of visceral leishmaniasis. The findings cumulatively provide a 
      strong evidence that voacamine can be a promising drug candidate against
      trypanosomatid infections.

AB  - Noribogaine is the main psychoactive metabolite of the hallucinogenic drug
      ibogaine, and is a particularly interesting compound potentially useful to treat 
      dependence and various psychiatric disorders. Here, we report the effects of
      noribogaine on anxiety and locomotion in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a new promising
      model organism in neurobehavioral and psychopharmacological research. Adult
      zebrafish were subjected to the 5min novel tank test (NTT) following an acute,
      20-min drug immersion in 1, 5 and 10mg/L noribogaine. Overall, noribogaine
      produced robust anxiolytic-like behavior in zebrafish (increasing the time spent 
      and transitions to the top half compartment and reducing freezing bouts) without 
      overt effects on fish locomotion. Taken together, these results indicate that
      noribogaine modulates the components of the acute stress response related to
      emotionality and anxiety behaviors, implicating this drug as a potentially useful
      non-sedative anxiolytic agent.

TI  - When transporters fail to be transported: how to rescue folding-deficient SLC6
      transporters.
PG  - 34-40
AB  - The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) belongs to the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) gene
      family. Point mutations in hDAT (SLC6A3) have been linked to a syndrome of
      dopamine transporter deficiency or infantile dystonia/parkinsonism. The mutations
      impair DAT folding, causing retention of variant DATs in the endoplasmic
      reticulum and subsequently impair transport activity. The folding trajectory of
      DAT itself is not understood, though many insights have been gained from studies 
      of folding-deficient mutants of the closely related serotonin transporter (SERT);
      i.e. their functional rescue by pharmacochaperoning with (nor)ibogaine or
      heat-shock protein inhibitors. We recently provided a proof-of-principle that
      folding-deficits in DAT are amenable to rescue in vitro and in vivo. As a model
      we used the Drosophila melanogaster DAT mutant dDAT-G108Q, which phenocopies the 
      fumin/sleepless DAT-knockout. Treatment with noribogaine and/or HSP70 inhibitor
      pifithrin-mu restored folding of, and dopamine transport by, dDAT-G108Q, its
      axonal delivery and normal sleep time in mutant flies. The possibility of
      functional rescue of misfolded DATs in living flies by pharmacochaperoning grants
      new therapeutic prospects in the remedy of folding diseases, not only in hDAT,
      but also in other SLC6 transporters, in particular mutants of the creatine
      transporter-1, which give rise to X-linked mental retardation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The psychoactive indole alkaloid ibogaine has been associated with
      encouraging treatment outcomes for opioid dependence. The legal status of
      ibogaine in New Zealand provides a unique opportunity to evaluate durability of
      treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine longitudinal treatment effects over a
      12-month period among individuals receiving legal ibogaine treatment for opioid
      dependence. METHOD: This observational study measured addiction severity as the
      primary outcome in 14 participants (50% female) over 12 months post-treatment
      using the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-Lite) following a single ibogaine
      treatment by either of two treatment providers. Secondary effects on depression
      were assessed via the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The Subjective
      Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) was collected before and immediately after
      treatment to measure opioid withdrawal symptoms. RESULTS: Nonparametric
      comparisons via Friedman Test between baseline and 12-month follow-up for
      participants completing all interviews (n = 8) showed a significant reduction for
      the ASI-Lite drug use (p = 0.002) composite score. Reductions in BDI-II scores
      from baseline to 12-month follow-up were also significant (p < 0.001).
      Significant reductions in SOWS scores for all participants (n = 14) were also
      observed acutely after treatment (p = 0.015). Patients with partial data (n = 4) 
      also showed reductions in ASI-Lite drug use scores and family/social status
      problems. One patient enrolled in the study died during treatment. CONCLUSION: A 
      single ibogaine treatment reduced opioid withdrawal symptoms and achieved opioid 
      cessation or sustained reduced use in dependent individuals as measured over 12
      months. Ibogaine's legal availability in New Zealand may offer improved outcomes 
      where legislation supports treatment providers to work closely with other health 
      professionals.

TI  - Examination of the Phenomenology of the Ibogaine Treatment Experience: Role of
      Altered States of Consciousness and Psychedelic Experiences.
PG  - 201-208

AB  - Psychedelic drugs have historically been used for ritualistic purposes and to
      help individuals gain insight. Ibogaine, a naturally occurring psychoactive
      substance, has been reported to have anti-addictive properties that aid in the
      treatment of substance use disorders. An online survey obtained retrospective
      data from individuals who used ibogaine in the past. Individuals who used
      ibogaine tended to describe thematically similar experiences post-treatment. This
      study adds to the literature by using the 5d-ASC, a psychometrically sound
      measure of altered states of consciousness (ASCs), to examine the ASCs induced by
      ibogaine and discusses the demographic characteristics of those who seek ibogaine
      treatment (N = 27). The study also examined several aspects of ibogaine treatment
      experience, including reasons for seeking treatment, course of treatment, and
      treatment outcome. Results indicated a positive correlation between the various
      dimensions of the ASCs and the outcome (ability to make changes in one's life,
      cravings, and how changed the person was as a result of ibogaine treatment).
      While this study is limited in generalizability due to high attrition and low
      sample size, it deepens the understanding of the phenomenological experience of
      ibogaine and explores the possible utility of ibogaine in the treatment of
      substance use disorders.

AB  - Iboga alkaloids are a particular class of indolomonoterpenes most often
      characterized by an isoquinuclidine nucleus. Their first occurrence was detected 
      in the roots of Tabernanthe iboga, a sacred plant to the people of Gabon, which
      made it cult object. Ibogaine is the main representative of this class of
      alkaloids and its psychoactive properties are well documented. It has been
      proposed as a drug cessation treatment and has a wide range of activities in
      targeting opioids, cocaine, and alcohol. The purpose of this chapter is to
      provide a background on this molecule and related compounds and to update
      knowledge on the most recent advances made. Difficulties linked to the status of 
      ibogaine as a drug in several countries have hampered its development, but
      18-methoxycoronaridine is currently under evaluation for the same purposes and
      for the treatment of leishmaniasis. The chapter is divided into six parts: an
      introduction aiming at defining what is called an iboga alkaloid, and this is
      followed by current knowledge on their biosynthesis, which unfortunately remains 
      a "black box" as far as the key construction step is concerned. Many of these
      alkaloids are still being discovered and the third and fourth parts of the
      chapter discuss the analytical tools in use for this purpose and give lists of
      new monomeric and dimeric alkaloids belonging to this class. When necessary, the 
      structures are discussed especially with regard to absolute configuration
      determinations, which remain a point of weakness in their assignments. Part V
      gives an account of progress made in the synthesis, partial and total, which the 
      authors believe is key to providing solid solutions to the industrial development
      of the most promising molecules. The last part of the chapter is devoted to the
      biological properties of iboga alkaloids, with particular emphasis on ibogaine
      and 18-methoxycoronaridine.

TI  - The contribution of alpha4beta2 and non-alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptors to the discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine and varenicline in
      mice.
PG  - 781-792
LID - 10.1007/s00213-016-4514-4 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The extent to which non-alpha4beta2 versus alpha4beta2* nAChRs
      contribute to the behavioral effects of varenicline and other nAChR agonists is
      unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the
      discriminative stimulus effects of varenicline and nicotine using various nAChR
      agonists and antagonists to elucidate possible non-alpha4beta2 nAChR mechanisms. 
      METHODS: Separate groups of male C57BL/6J mice were trained to discriminate
      varenicline (3.2 mg/kg) or nicotine (1 mg/kg). Test drugs included mecamylamine; 
      the nAChR agonists epibatidine, nicotine, cytisine, varenicline, and RTI-102; the
      beta2-containing nAChR antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE); the alpha7
      nAChR agonist PNU-282987; the alpha7 antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA); the
      alpha3beta4 antagonist 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC); and the non-nAChR drugs
      midazolam and cocaine. RESULTS: In nicotine-trained mice, maximum
      nicotine-appropriate responding was 95% nicotine, 94% epibatidine, 63%
      varenicline, 58% cytisine, and less than 50% for RTI-102, PNU-282987, midazolam, 
      and cocaine. In varenicline-trained mice, maximum varenicline-appropriate
      responding was 90% varenicline, 86% epibatidine, 74% cytisine, 80% RTI-102, 50%
      cocaine, and 50% or less for nicotine, PNU-282987, and midazolam. Drugs were
      studied to doses that abolished operant responding. Mecamylamine antagonized the 
      discriminative stimulus effects, but not the rate-decreasing effects, of nicotine
      and varenicline. DHbetaE antagonized the discriminative stimulus and
      rate-decreasing effects of nicotine but not varenicline in either the nicotine or
      varenicline discrimination assays. The discriminative stimulus, but not the
      rate-decreasing, effects of epibatidine were antagonized by DHbetaE regardless of
      the training drug. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that alpha4beta2* nAChRs
      differentially mediate the discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine and
      varenicline, and suggest that varenicline has substantial non-alpha4beta2 nAChR
      activity.

AB  - The ibogaine derivative 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) has been found to decrease
      self-administration of morphine, nicotine and alcohol in rats after systemic
      injection. However oral dosing is the preferred route clinically. The current
      study evaluated the effect of oral 18-MC dosing in rats on alcohol and nicotine
      self-administration. For the nicotine study, young adult female Sprague-Dawley
      rats were fitted with IV jugular infusion catheters and trained for nicotine
      self-administration in 45min. sessions. At weekly intervals they were
      administered by oral gavage doses of 18-MC (0, 10, 20 and 40mg/kg) following a
      repeated measures counterbalanced design twice. Acute oral 18-MC, at the 40mg/kg 
      dosage, significantly reduced nicotine self-administration. There was a
      differential effect of 18-MC with rats above or below the median level of
      nicotine self-administration during the pretreatment baseline performance. Rats
      with lower baseline performance showed a significant reduction in nicotine
      self-administration with the 40mg/kg dosage, while those in the higher baseline
      group did not show a significant effect of 18-MC. In alcohol studies, the effects
      of the same doses of 18-MC were tested in both male and female alcohol preferring
      (P) rats that had free access to water and alcohol (10% v/v) 6h/day. The results 
      show that 18-MC dose-dependently reduced alcohol intake in both male and female
      rats. All doses caused significant reductions in alcohol self-administration.
      These data reinforce previous findings that 18-MC is significantly effective in
      reducing alcohol intake and nicotine self-administration. The finding that 18-MC 
      is also effective orally makes it advantageous for further development as a
      possible new therapy for treating alcoholism as well as smoking addiction.

      Noribogaine in Opioid-Dependent Patients.
PG  - 460-468

AB  - Ibogaine is a psychoactive substance that may reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms. 
      This was the first clinical trial of noribogaine, ibogaine's active metabolite,
      in patients established on methadone opioid substitution therapy (OST). In this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending-dose study, we
      evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of noribogaine in 27
      patients seeking to discontinue methadone OST who had been switched to morphine
      during the previous week. Noribogaine doses were 60, 120, or 180 mg (n = 6/dose
      level) or matching placebo (n = 3/dose level). Noribogaine was well tolerated.
      The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were noneuphoric changes in
      light perception approximately 1 hour postdose, headache, and nausea. Noribogaine
      had dose-linear increases for AUC and Cmax and was slowly eliminated (mean t1/2
      range, 24-30 hours). There was a concentration-dependent increase in QTcI (0.17
      ms/ng/mL), with the largest observed mean effect of approximately 16, 28, and 42 
      milliseconds in the 60-, 120-, and 180-mg groups, respectively. Noribogaine
      showed a nonstatistically significant trend toward decreased total score in
      opioid withdrawal ratings, most notably at the 120-mg dose; however, the study
      design may have confounded evaluations of time to resumption of OST. Future
      exposure-controlled multiple-dose noribogaine studies are planned that will
      address these safety and design issues.

TI  - Vobasinyl-Iboga Alkaloids from Tabernaemontana elegans: Cell Cycle Arrest and
      Apoptosis-Inducing Activity in HCT116 Colon Cancer Cells.
PG  - 2624-2634
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of the roots of the African medicinal plant
      Tabernaemontana elegans led to the isolation of three new (1-3) and two known (4 
      and 5) bisindole alkaloids of the vobasinyl-iboga type. The structures of 1-3
      were assigned by spectroscopic methods, mainly using 1D and 2D NMR experiments.
      All of the isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against
      HCT116 colon and HepG2 liver carcinoma cells by the MTS metabolism assay.
      Compounds 1-3 and 5 were found to be cytotoxic to HCT116 colon cancer cells,
      displaying IC50 values in the range 8.4 to >10 muM. However, the compounds did
      not display significant cytotoxicity against HepG2 cancer cells. The cytotoxicity
      of compounds 1-3 and 5 was corroborated using a lactate dehydrogenase assay.
      Hoechst staining and nuclear morphology assessment and caspase-3/7 activity
      assays were also performed for investigating the activity of compounds 1-3 and 5 
      as apoptosis inducers. The induced inhibition of proliferation of HCT116 cells by
      compounds 1 and 2 was associated with G1 phase arrest, while compounds 3 and 5
      induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. These results showed that the new vobasinyl-iboga
      alkaloids 1-3 and compound 5 are strong inducers of apoptosis and cell cycle
      arrest in HCT116 colon cancer cells.

TI  - [Ibogaine - structure, influence on human body, clinical relevance].
PG  - 50-55
AB  - Ibogaine is a natural chemical compound, which belongs to the indole alkaloid
      family. It can be naturally found within the root bark of african plant
      Tabernanthe iboga. Ibogaine plays a significant role among tribal cultures.
      Ibogaine, in small amount, causes reduction of hunger, thirst and exhaustion. In 
      bigger amount, however, it can cause intensive visions. Other effects include
      reduction or complete disappearance of absitnence symptoms visible in people
      addicted to the nicotine, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine or opioids, what has 
      been scientifically proven after the tests on animals and small groups of people.
      After oral application, 80% of ibogaine is subjected to the Odemethylation into
      noribogaine; main catalyzing enzyme is cytochrome CYP2D6. Research suggests, that
      ibogaine acts in many places within central nervous system. NMDA receptors seem
      to play main role in its anti-addiction properties. It is important to mention
      the side effects of the compound, which are cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity,
      what makes it harder to use its beneficial properties. Because of this, Ibogaine 
      is included among the dangerous substance. However, there are a few clinics in
      the world which specializes in the use of the compound in order to interrupt the 
      sypmtoms acute opioid withdrawal syndrome as well as a substance benficial in
      curing other addictions. There is more hope with synthetic derivatives of
      ibogaine, which although are less toxic still keep their anti-addiction
      properties. The aim is to collect the available knowledge related to the
      structure and effects on human body of alkaloid Tabernanthe iboga and consider
      the possibility of commercial medical use.

TI  - Pharmacological Chaperones of the Dopamine Transporter Rescue Dopamine
      Transporter Deficiency Syndrome Mutations in Heterologous Cells.
PG  - 22053-22062
AB  - A number of pathological conditions have been linked to mutations in the dopamine
      transporter gene, including hereditary dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome
      (DTDS). DTDS is a rare condition that is caused by autosomal recessive
      loss-of-function mutations in the dopamine transporter (DAT), which often affects
      transporter trafficking and folding. We examined the possibility of using
      pharmacological chaperones of DAT to rescue DTDS mutations. After screening a set
      of known DAT ligands for their ability to increase DAT surface expression, we
      found that bupropion and ibogaine increased DAT surface expression, whereas
      others, including cocaine and methylphenidate, had no effect. Bupropion and
      ibogaine increased wild type DAT protein levels and also promoted maturation of
      the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained DAT mutant K590A. Rescue of K590A could
      be blocked by inhibiting ER to Golgi transport using brefeldin A. Furthermore,
      knockdown of coat protein complex II (COPII) component SEC24D, which is important
      in the ER export of wild type DAT, also blocked the rescue effects of bupropion
      and ibogaine. These data suggest that bupropion and ibogaine promote maturation
      of DAT by acting as pharmacological chaperones in the ER. Importantly, both drugs
      rescue DAT maturation and functional activity of the DTDS-associated mutations
      A314V and R445C. Together, these results are the first demonstration of
      pharmacological chaperoning of DAT and suggest this may be a viable approach to
      increase DAT levels in DTDS and other conditions associated with reduced DAT
      function.

LID - 10.1074/jbc.M116.737551 [doi]
AB  - Folding-defective mutants of the human dopamine transporter (DAT) cause a
      syndrome of infantile dystonia/parkinsonism. Here, we provide a
      proof-of-principle that the folding deficit is amenable to correction in vivo by 
      two means, the cognate DAT ligand noribogaine and the HSP70 inhibitor,
      pifithrin-mu. We examined the Drosophila melanogaster (d) mutant dDAT-G108Q,
      which leads to a sleepless phenotype in flies harboring this mutation. Molecular 
      dynamics simulations suggested an unstable structure of dDAT-G108Q consistent
      with a folding defect. This conjecture was verified; heterologously expressed
      dDAT-G108Q and the human (h) equivalent hDAT-G140Q were retained in the
      endoplasmic reticulum in a complex with endogenous folding sensors (calnexin and 
      HSP70-1A). Incubation of the cells with noribogaine (a DAT ligand selective for
      the inward-facing state) and/or pifithrin-mu (an HSP70 inhibitor) restored
      folding of, and hence dopamine transport by, dDAT-G108Q and hDAT-G140Q. The
      mutated versions of DAT were confined to the cell bodies of the dopaminergic
      neurons in the fly brain and failed to reach the axonal compartments. Axonal
      delivery was restored, and sleep time was increased to normal length (from 300 to
      1000 min/day) if the dDAT-G108Q-expressing flies were treated with noribogaine
      and/or pifithrin-mu. Rescuing misfolded versions of DAT by pharmacochaperoning is
      of therapeutic interest; it may provide opportunities to remedy disorders arising
      from folding-defective mutants of human DAT and of other related SLC6
      transporters.

      10 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) and one simple indole alkaloid, nine of 
      which were reported for the first time in these species. Furthermore, callus
      cultures were established from T. alba leaf explants and regeneration of whole
      plants was accomplished via somatic embryogenesis. The anti-addictive MIAs
      ibogaine and voacangine were then quantified by gas chromatography with flame
      ionization detection in wild plants of both species, as well as greenhouse-grown 
      plants, in vitro-grown plantlets and embryogenic callus of T. alba. Ibogaine and 
      voacangine were present in most samples taken from the whole plants of both
      species, with stem and root barks showing the highest concentrations. No
      alkaloids were detected in callus samples. It was concluded that T. alba and T.
      arborea are potentially viable sources of ibogaine and voacangine, and that these
      MIAs can be produced through somatic embryogenesis and whole plant regeneration
      of T. alba. Approaches to increase MIA yields in whole plants and to achieve
      alkaloid production directly in cell cultures are discussed.

AB  - The indole alkaloid ibogaine, present in the root bark of the West African rain
      forest shrub Tabernanthe iboga, has been adopted in the West as a treatment for
      drug dependence. Treatment of patients requires large doses of the alkaloid to
      cause hallucinations, an alleged integral part of the patient's treatment regime.
      However, case reports and case series continue to describe evidences of ataxia,
      gastrointestinal distress, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden and unexplained
      deaths of patients undergoing treatment for drug dependence. High doses of
      ibogaine act on several classes of neurological receptors and transporters to
      achieve pharmacological responses associated with drug aversion; limited
      toxicology research suggests that intraperitoneal doses used to successfully
      treat rodents, for example, have also been shown to cause neuronal injury
      (purkinje cells) in the rat cerebellum. Limited research suggests lethality in
      rodents by the oral route can be achieved at approximately 263mg/kg body weight. 
      To consider an appropriate and safe initial dose for humans, necessary safety
      factors need to be applied to the animal data; these would include factors such
      as intra- and inter-species variability and for susceptible people in a
      population (such as drug users). A calculated initial dose to treat patients
      could be approximated at 0.87mg/kg body weight, substantially lower than those
      presently being administered to treat drug users. Morbidities and mortalities
      will continue to occur unless practitioners reconsider doses being administered
      to their susceptible patients.

AB  - Powdered roots of iboga (Tabernanthe iboga) contain ibogaine, an alkaloid that
      has been used to treat addictions. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who 
      died after ingesting a powder labeled as Tabernanthe iboga she had bought online.
      Analysis of the powder revealed the absence of ibogaine but the presence of toxic
      alkaloids (ajmaline, yohimbine and reserpine) found in Rauvolfia sp. plant
      species. An original and specific LC-MS/MS method developed to quantify ajmaline,
      yohimbine and reserpine showed respective concentrations of 109.1ng/mL, 98.2ng/mL
      and 30.8ng/mL in blood, and 1528.2ng/mL, 914.2ng/mL and 561.2ng/mL in bile.
      Moreover, systematic toxicological analyses of biological samples showed the
      presence of oxazepam at therapeutic concentration and cannabinoids. Death could
      be attributed to ingestion of a substantial quantity of crushed roots of
      Rauvolfia in association with concomitant drug withdrawal.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of hERG Channel Blocking Voacangine in Wistar Rats Applying a
      Validated LC-ESI-MS/MS Method.
PG  - 1030-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-107800 [doi]
AB  - Herbal preparations from Voacanga africana are used in West and Central African
      folk medicine and are also becoming increasingly popular as a legal high in
      Europe. Recently, the main alkaloid voacangine was found to be a potent human
      ether-a-go-go-related gene channel blocker in vitro. Blockage of this channel
      might imply possible cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
      characterise voacangine in vivo to assess its pharmacokinetics and to estimate if
      further studies to investigate its cardiotoxic risk are required. Male Wistar
      rats received different doses of voacangine as a pure compound and as a
      hydro-ethanolic extract of V. africana root bark with a quantified amount of 9.71
      % voacangine. For the obtained data, a simultaneous population pharmacokinetics
      model was successfully developed, comprising a two-compartment model for i. v.
      dosing and a one-compartmental model with two first-order absorption rates for
      oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability of voacangine was determined to be
      11-13 %. Model analysis showed significant differences in the first absorption
      rate constant for voacangine administered as a pure compound and voacangine from 
      the extract of V. africana. Taking into account the obtained low bioavailability 
      of voacangine, its cardiotoxic risk might be neglectable in healthy consumers,
      but may have a serious impact in light of drug/drug interactions and impaired
      health conditions.

TI  - Ibogaine and addiction in the animal model, a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - e826
LID - 10.1038/tp.2016.71 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring substance which has been increasingly used in
      the lay-scene to reduce craving and relapse in patients with substance use
      disorders (SUDs). Although human clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of
      ibogaine are lacking, animal studies do support the efficacy of ibogaine. In this
      systematic review and meta-analysis (MA), we summarise these animal findings,
      addressing three questions: (1) does ibogaine reduce addictive behaviour in
      animal models of SUDs?; (2) what are the toxic effects of ibogaine on motor
      functioning, cerebellum and heart rhythm?; (3) what are neuropharmacological
      working mechanisms of ibogaine treatment in animal models of SUDs? MA of 27
      studies showed that ibogaine reduced drug self-administration, particularly
      during the first 24 h after administration. Ibogaine had no effect on
      drug-induced conditioned place preference. Ibogaine administration resulted in
      motor impairment in the first 24 h after supplementation, and cerebral cell loss 
      even weeks after administration. Data on ibogaines effect on cardiac rhythm, as
      well as on its neuropharmacological working mechanisms are limited. Our results
      warrant further studies into the clinical efficacy of ibogaine in SUD patients in
      reducing craving and substance use, but close monitoring of the patients is
      recommended because of the possible toxic effects. In addition, more work is
      needed to unravel the neuropharmacological working mechanisms of ibogaine and to 
      investigate its effects on heart rhythm.

TI  - Remission of Severe Opioid Use Disorder with Ibogaine: A Case Report.
PG  - 214-7
LID - 10.1080/02791072.2016.1180467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorders (OUD) translate into major health, social, and
      economic consequences. Opioid agonist medications, which generally require
      long-term administration, are the mainstay pharmacological treatment of OUD.
      However, a large proportion of individuals with OUD either refuse or fail to
      respond to these therapies. Ibogaine, a naturally occurring substance found in
      the Tabernanthe iboga plant, has shown potential to bring about transformative or
      spiritual experiences that have reportedly been associated with long-term
      abstinece. Although research on ibogaine is limited, an ibogaine subculture
      persists, offering unregulated ibogaine preparations for the treatment of
      addiction. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 37-year-old female with a
      19-year history of severe OUD achieving an ongoing 18-month period of abstinence 
      following a four-day ibogaine treatment. Her previous longest period of
      continuous abstinence from opioids was two months while on methadone. No safety
      issues associated with ibogaine were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A four-day treatment 
      with ibogaine was succesful in achieving long-term remission of a previously
      treatment-refractory patient with severe OUD. While rigorous trials are required 
      to establish safety and efficacy, future studies should seek to delineate the
      potential role of ibogaine or other molecules that may produce transformative
      experiences for individuals with substance use disorder.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Root bark from Tabernanthe iboga has been used
      traditionally in West Africa as a psychoactive substance in religious rituals. In
      smaller doses it is reported anecdotally to have stimulant properties. AIM OF THE
      STUDY: To evaluate the influence of a single 20mg ibogaine dose on psychological 
      variables reflecting subjective mood state and a range of cognitive functions.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 healthy male volunteers received single 20mg doses of
      ibogaine after 6 days pretreatment with double-blind paroxetine or placebo. We
      compared responses to a battery of psychometric tests and subjective mood ratings
      performed before and 2h after ibogaine dosing, and assessed relationships between
      changes in test scores and concentrations of active moiety (the sum of molar
      noribogaine and ibogaine concentrations). Psychological tests were chosen based
      on responsiveness to opioid and serotonergic ligands. RESULTS: Ibogaine had
      minimal influence on psychological tests and mood ratings. The ability to
      selectively ignore distracting spatial information showed some evidence of
      modulation; however because this effect was limited to the less challenging
      condition calls into question the reliability of this result. CONCLUSION: We were
      unable to identify stimulant effects after single 20mg doses of ibogaine. Future 
      research is needed to confirm whether active moiety concentrations impact
      selective attention abilities while leaving other cognitive functions and mood
      state unaffected.

TI  - Ibogaine-associated cardiac arrest and death: case report and review of the
      literature.
PG  - 95-8
LID - 10.1177/2045125315626073 [doi]
AB  - A naturally occurring hallucinogenic plant alkaloid, ibogaine has been used as an
      adjuvant for opiate withdrawal for the past 50 years. In the setting of an
      escalating nationwide opiate epidemic, use of substances such as ibogaine may
      also increase. Therefore, familiarity with the mechanisms and potential adverse
      effects of ibogaine is important for clinicians. We present the case report of a 
      man whose use of ibogaine resulted in cardiac arrest and death, complemented by a
      review of the literature regarding ibogaine's clinical effects. A 40-year-old man
      who used ibogaine for symptoms of heroin withdrawal suffered acute cardiac arrest
      leading to cerebral edema and brain death. His presentation was consistent with
      ibogaine-induced cardiotoxicity and ibogaine-induced cardiac arrest, and a review
      of the literature regarding the history, mechanisms, risks and clinical outcomes 
      associated with ibogaine is presented. The case presented underscores the
      significant potential clinical risks of ibogaine. It is important the healthcare 
      community be aware of the possible effects of ibogaine such that clinicians can
      provide informed counseling to their patients regarding the risks of attempting
      detoxification with ibogaine.

TI  - Control of serotonin transporter phosphorylation by conformational state.
PG  - E2776-83
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1603282113 [doi]
AB  - Serotonin transporter (SERT) is responsible for reuptake and recycling of
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) after its exocytotic release during
      neurotransmission. Mutations in human SERT are associated with psychiatric
      disorders and autism. Some of these mutations affect the regulation of SERT
      activity by cGMP-dependent phosphorylation. Here we provide direct evidence that 
      this phosphorylation occurs at Thr276, predicted to lie near the cytoplasmic end 
      of transmembrane helix 5 (TM5). Using membranes from HeLa cells expressing SERT
      and intact rat basophilic leukemia cells, we show that agents such as Na(+) and
      cocaine that stabilize outward-open conformations of SERT decreased
      phosphorylation and agents that stabilize inward-open conformations (e.g., 5-HT, 
      ibogaine) increased phosphorylation. The opposing effects of the inhibitors
      cocaine and ibogaine were each reversed by an excess of the other inhibitor.
      Inhibition of phosphorylation by Na(+) and stimulation by ibogaine occurred at
      concentrations that induced outward opening and inward opening, respectively, as 
      measured by the accessibility of cysteine residues in the extracellular and
      cytoplasmic permeation pathways, respectively. The results are consistent with a 
      mechanism of SERT regulation that is activated by the transport of 5-HT, which
      increases the level of inward-open SERT and may lead to unwinding of the TM5
      helix to allow phosphorylation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Continuous video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring remains
      the gold standard for seizure liability assessments in preclinical drug safety
      assessments. EEG monitored by telemetry was used to assess the behavioral and EEG
      effects of noribogaine hydrochloride (noribogaine) in cynomolgus monkeys.
      Noribogaine is an iboga alkaloid being studied for the treatment of opioid
      dependence. METHODS: Six cynomolgus monkeys (3 per gender) were instrumented with
      EEG telemetry transmitters. Noribogaine was administered to each monkey at both
      doses (i.e., 160 and 320mg/kg, PO) with an interval between dosing of at least
      6days, and the resulting behavioral and EEG effects were evaluated. IV
      pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), served as a positive control for induced seizures.
      RESULTS: The administration of noribogaine at either of the doses evaluated was
      not associated with EEG evidence of seizure or with EEG signals known to be
      premonitory signs of increased seizure risk (e.g., sharp waves, unusual
      synchrony, shifts to high-frequency patterns). Noribogaine was associated with a 
      mild reduction in activity levels, increased scratching, licking and chewing, and
      some degree of poor coordination and related clinical signs. A single monkey
      exhibited brief myoclonic movements that increased in frequency at the high dose,
      but which did not appear to generalize, cluster or to be linked with EEG
      abnormalities. Noribogaine was also associated with emesis and partial anorexia. 
      In contrast, PTZ was associated with substantial pre-ictal EEG patterns including
      large amplitude, repetitive sharp waves leading to generalized seizures and to
      typical post-ictal EEG frequency attenuation. INTERPRETATION: EEG patterns were
      within normal limits following administration of noribogaine at doses up to
      320mg/kg with concurrent clinical signs that correlated with plasma exposures and
      resolved by the end of the monitoring period. PTZ was invariably associated with 
      EEG paroxysmal activity leading to ictal EEG. In the current study, a noribogaine
      dose of 320mg/kg was considered to be the EEG no observed adverse effect level
      (NOAEL) in conscious freely moving cynomolgus monkeys.

TI  - Ibogan, Aspidosperman, Vincamine, and Bisindole Alkaloids from a Malayan
      Tabernaemontana corymbosa: Iboga Alkaloids with C-20alpha Substitution.
PG  - 1388-99
LID - 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00129 [doi]
AB  - Ten new indole alkaloids (1-10) comprising five ibogan, two aspidosperman, one
      vincamine, and two bisindole alkaloids, in addition to 32 known alkaloids, were
      isolated from the stem-bark extract of a Malayan Tabernaemontana corymbosa. The
      structures of these alkaloids were determined based on analysis of the NMR and MS
      data and, in five instances (1, 3, 5, 6, 8), confirmed by X-ray diffraction
      analysis. Two of the iboga alkaloids, conodusines B (2) and C (3), and the
      iboga-containing bisindole tabernamidine B (10) are notable for the presence of
      an alpha-substituted acetyl group at C-20 of the iboga carbon skeleton. The iboga
      alkaloid (+)-conodusine E (5) had MS and NMR data that were identical to those of
      (-)-ervatamine I, recently isolated from Ervatamia hainanensis. Establishment of 
      the absolute configuration of (+)-conodusine E (5) was based on analysis of the
      ECD data, correlation with (-)-heyneanine, and X-ray analysis, which showed that 
      (+)-5 belongs to the same enantiomeric series as exemplified by (-)-coronaridine.
      The configuration at C-20' of the previously reported Tabernaemontana bisindole
      alkaloid 19'-oxotabernamine (renamed tabernamidine B) required revision based on 
      the present results. Several of the bisindoles showed pronounced in vitro growth 
      inhibitory activity against drug-sensitive and vincristine-resistant KB cells.

      neurochemical sensitization to nicotine.

AB  - Systemic 18-methoxycoronaridine, an alpha3beta4 nicotinic antagonist, slows the
      rate of induction of behavioral sensitization to nicotine (Glick et al., 1996;
      2011). The primary mechanism of action of 18-MC is believed to be the inhibition 
      of alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which are densely expressed in
      the medial habenula and interpeduncular nucleus (Pace et al., 2004; Glick et al.,
      2012). Recently, these habenular nicotinic receptors and their multiple roles in 
      nicotine aversion and withdrawal have been increasingly emphasized
      (Antolin-Fontes et al., 2015). Here, we investigated the effects of 18-MC on both
      behavioral and neurochemical sensitization to nicotine. Daily systemic
      administration of 18-MC slowed the rate of induction of behavioral sensitization 
      to nicotine but failed to block the expression of a sensitized locomotor response
      when absent. In contrast, in nicotine sensitized animals, systemic 18-MC
      significantly reduced the expression of behavioral sensitization. Results from
      intra-habenular administration of 18-MC paralleled these findings in that the
      expression of behavioral sensitization was also reduced in sensitized animals.
      Consistent with its effects on behavioral sensitization, intra-MHb treatment with
      18-MC completely abolished sensitized dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens
      in nicotine sensitized animals. These results show that alpha3beta4 nicotinic
      receptors in the MHb contribute to nicotine sensitization, a phenomenon
      associated with drug craving and relapse.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of noribogaine, the principal metabolite of
      the drug ibogaine, on substance-related disorders. In the first experiment, mice 
      chronically treated with morphine were subjected to naloxone-precipitated
      withdrawal two hours after oral administration of noribogaine. Oral noribogaine
      dose dependently decreased the global opiate withdrawal score by up to 88% of
      vehicle control with an ED50 of 13 mg/kg. In the second experiment, blood and
      brain levels of noribogaine showed a high brain penetration and a brain/blood
      ratio of 7+/-1 across all doses tested. In a third experiment, rats given oral
      noribogaine up to 100 mg/kg were tested for abuse liability using a standard
      biased conditioned place paradigm. Noribogaine-treated rats did not display place
      preference, suggesting that noribogaine is not perceived as a hedonic stimulus in
      rodents. Retrospective review of published studies assessing the efficacy of
      ibogaine on morphine withdrawal shows that the most likely cause of the
      discrepancies in the literature is the different routes of administration and
      time of testing following ibogaine administration. These results suggest that the
      metabolite noribogaine rather than the parent compound mediates the effects of
      ibogaine on blocking naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Noribogaine may hold
      promise as a non-addicting alternative to standard opiate replacement therapies
      to transition patients to opiate abstinence.

AB  - Ibogaine is a plant alkaloid used as anti-addiction drug in dozens of alternative
      medicine clinics worldwide. Recently, alarming reports of life-threatening
      cardiac arrhythmias and cases of sudden death associated with the ingestion of
      ibogaine have accumulated. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we assessed
      the effects of ibogaine and its main metabolite noribogaine on action potentials 
      in human ventricular-like cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem
      cells. Therapeutic concentrations of ibogaine and its long-lived active
      metabolite noribogaine significantly retarded action potential repolarization in 
      human cardiomyocytes. These findings represent the first experimental proof that 
      ibogaine application entails a cardiac arrhythmia risk for humans. In addition,
      they explain the clinically observed delayed incidence of cardiac adverse events 
      several days after ibogaine intake. We conclude that therapeutic concentrations
      of ibogaine retard action potential repolarization in the human heart. This may
      give rise to a prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram and
      cardiac arrhythmias.

TI  - How toxic is ibogaine?
PG  - 297-302
LID - 10.3109/15563650.2016.1138226 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Ibogaine is a psychoactive indole alkaloid found in the African
      rainforest shrub Tabernanthe Iboga. It is unlicensed but used in the treatment of
      drug and alcohol addiction. However, reports of ibogaine's toxicity are cause for
      concern. OBJECTIVES: To review ibogaine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, 
      mechanisms of action and reported toxicity. METHODS: A search of the literature
      available on PubMed was done, using the keywords "ibogaine" and "noribogaine".
      The search criteria were "mechanism of action", "pharmacokinetics",
      "pharmacodynamics", "neurotransmitters", "toxicology", "toxicity", "cardiac",
      "neurotoxic", "human data", "animal data", "addiction", "anti-addictive",
      "withdrawal", "death" and "fatalities". The searches identified 382 unique
      references, of which 156 involved human data. Further research revealed 14
      detailed toxicological case reports. PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS:
      Ibogaine is metabolized mainly by CYP2D6 to the primary metabolite noribogaine
      (10-hydroxyibogamine). Noribogaine is present in clinically relevant
      concentrations for days, long after ibogaine has been cleared. MECHANISMS OF
      ACTION: Ibogaine and noribogaine interact with multiple neurotransmitter systems.
      They show micromolar affinity for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kappa- and
      mu-opioid receptors and sigma-2 receptor sites. Furthermore, ibogaine has been
      shown to interact with the acetylcholine, serotonin and dopamine systems; it
      alters the expression of several proteins including substance P, brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), c-fos and egr-1. NEUROTOXICITY: Neurodegeneration was
      shown in rats, probably mediated by stimulation of the inferior olive, which has 
      excitotoxic effects on Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Neurotoxic effects of
      ibogaine may not be directly relevant to its anti-addictive properties, as no
      signs of neurotoxicity were found following doses lower than 25 mg/kg
      intra-peritoneal in rats. Noribogaine might be less neurotoxic than ibogaine.
      CARDIOTOXICITY: Ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channels in the heart
      might play a crucial role in ibogaine's cardiotoxicity, as hERG channels are
      vital in the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials and blockade by
      ibogaine delays this repolarization, resulting in QT (time interval between the
      start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the
      heart) interval prolongation and, subsequently, in arrhythmias and sudden cardiac
      arrest. Twenty-seven fatalities have been reported following the ingestion of
      ibogaine, and pre-existing cardiovascular conditions have been implicated in the 
      death of individuals for which post-mortem data were available. However, in this 
      review, 8 case reports are presented which suggest that ibogaine caused
      ventricular tachyarrhythmias and prolongation of the QT interval in individuals
      without any pre-existing cardiovascular condition or family history. Noribogaine 
      appears at least as harmful to cardiac functioning as ibogaine. TOXICITY FROM
      DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION: Polymorphism in the CYP2D6 enzyme can influence blood
      concentrations of both ibogaine and its primary metabolite, which may have
      implications when a patient is taking other medication that is subject to
      significant CYP2D6 metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative therapists and drug users
      are still using iboga extract, root scrapings, and ibogaine hydrochloride to
      treat drug addiction. With limited medical supervision, these are risky
      experiments and more ibogaine-related deaths are likely to occur, particularly in
      those with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those taking concurrent
      medications.

TI  - Switching Opioid-Dependent Patients From Methadone to Morphine: Safety,
      Tolerability, and Methadone Pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 960-5
LID - 10.1002/jcph.704 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to switch patients established on methadone opioid
      substitution therapy (OST) to morphine over 1 week. Subjects established on daily
      methadone OST (mean dose 60 mg/day) were switched to morphine slow-release
      capsules, dosed at 4x the previous total daily methadone dose, for 6 days, then
      given morphine syrup dosed q3h. All 27 subjects enrolled in this study completed 
      the switch from methadone to morphine. Opioid withdrawal symptoms (OWS) peaked
      within 12-24 hours of starting morphine, and 24/27 subjects required higher daily
      morphine doses (mean 5.2x multiple). Pharmacokinetic evaluation showed that 91%
      of methadone was cleared during this time, with a mean elimination half-life of
      59 hours. The most frequent treatment-emergent non-OWS adverse events were
      headache, nausea, constipation, and neck pain. The method described here appears 
      to be a safe and acceptable approach to switch subjects from methadone to
      morphine.

TI  - "Herbal seizures"--atypical symptoms after ibogaine intoxication: a case report.
PG  - 243
LID - 10.1186/s13256-015-0731-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Misuse of various new psychotropic substances such as ibogaine is
      increasing rapidly. Knowledge of their negative side effects is sparse. CASE
      PRESENTATION: We present a case of intoxication with the herbal substance
      ibogaine in a 22-year-old white man. After taking a cumulative dose of 38 g
      (taken in two doses), he developed visual memories, nausea and vomiting. He
      developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure with additional grand mal seizures. 
      He was treated with midazolam and levetiracetam. Extended drug screenings and
      computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings were all negative.
      CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the side effects of ibogaine has mainly come from
      reports of cardiovascular complications; seizures are rarely mentioned and
      experimental findings are inconsistent. It seems that ibogaine acts like a
      proconvulsive drug at high doses.

TI  - Deconstructing the Iboga Alkaloid Skeleton: Potentiation of FGF2-induced Glial
      Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Release by a Novel Compound.
PG  - 77-87
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.5b00678 [doi]
AB  - Modulation of growth factor signaling pathways in the brain represents a new
      experimental approach to treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, 
      anxiety, and addiction. Neurotrophins and growth factors exert synaptic,
      neuronal, and circuit level effects on a wide temporal range, which suggests a
      possibility of rapid and lasting therapeutic effects. Consequently,
      identification of small molecules that can either enhance the release of growth
      factors or potentiate their respective pathways will provide a drug-like
      alternative to direct neurotrophin administration or viral gene delivery and thus
      represents an important frontier in chemical biology and drug design. Glial cell 
      line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), in particular, has been implicated in
      marked reduction of alcohol consumption in rodent addiction models, and the
      natural product ibogaine, a substance used traditionally in ritualistic
      ceremonies, has been suggested to increase the synthesis and release of GDNF in
      the dopaminergic system in rats. In this report, we describe a novel iboga
      analog, XL-008, created by unraveling the medium size ring of the ibogamine
      skeleton, and its ability to induce release of GDNF in C6 glioma cells.
      Additionally, XL-008 potentiates the release of GDNF induced by fibroblast growth
      factor 2 (FGF2), another neurotrophin implicated in major depressive disorder,
      increasing potency more than 2-fold (from 7.85 +/- 2.59 ng/mL to 3.31 +/- 0.98
      ng/mL) and efficacy more than 3-fold. The GDNF release by both XL-008 and the
      FGF2/XL-008 mixture was found to be mediated through the MEK and PI3K signaling
      pathways but not through PLCgamma in C6 glioma cells.

TI  - [Psychedelics and quasi-psychedelics in the light of contemporary research:
      medical cannabis, MDMA, salvinorin A, ibogaine and ayahuasca].
PG  - 120-8
AB  - In lack of professional research and appropriate concepts our scientific
      knowledge of psychedelic agents is limited. According to the long-held official
      view these drugs are entirely harmful and have no medical use. However, a recent 
      surge of clinical and pharmacological studies in the field indicates that many
      psychedelic-like agents have therapeutic potentials under proper circumstances.
      In this paper, from a biomedical and psychological perspective, we provide a
      brief review of the general effects and promising treatment uses of medical
      cannabis, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), salvinorin A, ibogaine and
      the dimethyltryptamine-(DMT)-containing ayahuasca. In Hungary - similarly to many
      other countries - these compounds are classified as "narcotic drugs" and their
      research is difficult due to strict regulations.

AB  - Noribogaine is the long-lived human metabolite of the anti-addictive substance
      ibogaine. Noribogaine efficaciously reaches the brain with concentrations up to
      20 muM after acute therapeutic dose of 40 mg/kg ibogaine in animals. Noribogaine 
      displays atypical opioid-like components in vivo, anti-addictive effects and
      potent modulatory properties of the tolerance to opiates for which the mode of
      action remained uncharacterized thus far. Our binding experiments and
      computational simulations indicate that noribogaine may bind to the orthosteric
      morphinan binding site of the opioid receptors. Functional activities of
      noribogaine at G-protein and non G-protein pathways of the mu and kappa opioid
      receptors were characterized. Noribogaine was a weak mu antagonist with a
      functional inhibition constants (Ke) of 20 muM at the G-protein and beta-arrestin
      signaling pathways. Conversely, noribogaine was a G-protein biased kappa agonist 
      75% as efficacious as dynorphin A at stimulating GDP-GTP exchange (EC50=9 muM)
      but only 12% as efficacious at recruiting beta-arrestin, which could contribute
      to the lack of dysphoric effects of noribogaine. In turn, noribogaine
      functionally inhibited dynorphin-induced kappa beta-arrestin recruitment and was 
      more potent than its G-protein agonistic activity with an IC50 of 1 muM. This
      biased agonist/antagonist pharmacology is unique to noribogaine in comparison to 
      various other ligands including ibogaine, 18-MC, nalmefene, and 6'-GNTI. We
      predict noribogaine to promote certain analgesic effects as well as
      anti-addictive effects at effective concentrations>1 muM in the brain. Because
      elevated levels of dynorphins are commonly observed and correlated with anxiety, 
      dysphoric effects, and decreased dopaminergic tone, a therapeutically relevant
      functional inhibition bias to endogenously released dynorphins by noribogaine
      might be worthy of consideration for treating anxiety and substance related
      disorders.

AB  - Previous investigations demonstrated that pretreatment with non-cytotoxic
      concentrations of voacamine had a chemosensitizing effect on cultured multidrug
      resistant osteosarcoma cells exposed to doxorubicin; whereas when used alone at
      high concentrations voacamine induced apoptosis-independent cell death on both
      sensitive and resistant cells. To gain insight into the mechanism of action of
      voacamine at the subcellular level, we developed an analytical high-performance
      thin-layer chromatography technique to assess the intracellular content of
      voacamine that could be correlated with the induction of cell death and
      consequent morphological and ultrastructural changes. The results of the
      quantitative analysis not only did allow us to measure both the amount of
      unmodified voacamine molecules (determined by the method) and the amount of
      molecules which reacted with cellular components (undetectable), but also to
      confirm the findings of our previous studies and support the validity of this
      method.

AB  - Four alkaloids, voacangine (1), isovoacangine (2), coronaridine (3), and
      coronaridine hydroxyindolenine (4), were isolated from the MeOH extract of
      Tabernaemontana divaricata aerial parts by activity-guided fractionation for Wnt 
      signal inhibitory activity. Compounds 1-4 exhibited TCF/beta-catenin inhibitory
      activities with IC50 values of 11.5, 6.0, 5.8, and 7.3 muM, respectively. Of
      these, coronaridine (3) decreased beta-catenin levels in SW480 colon cancer
      cells, while this decrease in beta-catenin was not suppressed by a co-treatment
      with 3 and MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggested that the
      decrease observed in beta-catenin levels by coronaridine (3) did not depend on a 
      proteasomal degradation process. On the other hand, the treatment of SW480 cells 
      with coronaridine (3) caused a decrease in beta-catenin mRNA levels. Thus,
      coronaridine (3) may inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway by decreasing the mRNA
      expression of beta-catenin.

AB  - A new monoterpenoid indole alkaloid compound (1) and six known monoterpenoid
      indole alkaloids compounds (2-7) were isolated from the barks of Voacanga
      africana Staph. The structures were established by spectral analysis as
      ibogamine-16-carboxylic acid,17,20-didehydro-5,6-dioxo-10-methoxy-methyl ester
      (1), voacamine (2), vobasine (3), voacangine (4), voacristine (5),
      19-epi-voacristine (6) and 19-epi-heyneanine (7). Compound 1 was confirmed by
      X-ray crystallographic analysis. All of the isolated compounds were evaluated for
      cytotoxicity against five cell lines (HEPG-2, A375, MDA-MB-231, SH-SY5Y, CT26).
      Among them, compounds 2 and 6 displayed significant inhibitory activities,
      compounds 3, 4 and 5 showed moderate inhibitory activities, while compounds 1 and
      7 showed no inhibitory activities against the five cell lines.

      receptors by interacting with luminal and non-luminal sites.

AB  - To characterize the interaction of coronaridine congeners with human (h)
      alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), structural and functional 
      approaches were used. The Ca(2+) influx results established that coronaridine
      congeners noncompetitively inhibit halpha3beta4 AChRs with the following potency 
      (IC50's in muM) sequence: (-)-ibogamine (0.62+/-0.23) approximately
      (+)-catharanthine (0.68+/-0.10)>(-)-ibogaine
      (0.95+/-0.10)>(+/-)-18-methoxycoronaridine [(+/-)-18-MC]
      (1.47+/-0.21)>(-)-voacangine (2.28+/-0.33)>(+/-)-18-methylaminocoronaridine
      (2.62+/-0.57 muM) approximately (+/-)-18-hydroxycoronaridine
      (2.81+/-0.54)>(-)-noribogaine (6.82+/-0.78). A good linear correlation
      (r(2)=0.771) between the calculated IC50 values and their polar surface area was 
      found, suggesting that this is an important structural feature for its activity. 
      The radioligand competition results indicate that (+/-)-18-MC and (-)-ibogaine
      partially inhibit [(3)H]imipramine binding by an allosteric mechanism. Molecular 
      docking, molecular dynamics, and in silico mutation results suggest that
      protonated (-)-18-MC binds to luminal [i.e., beta4-Phe255 (phenylalanine/valine
      ring; position 13'), and alpha3-Leu250 and beta4-Leu251 (leucine ring; position
      9')], non-luminal, and intersubunit sites. The pharmacophore model suggests that 
      nitrogens from the ibogamine core as well as methylamino, hydroxyl, and methoxyl 
      moieties at position 18 form hydrogen bonds. Collectively our data indicate that 
      coronaridine congeners inhibit halpha3beta4 AChRs by blocking the ion channel's
      lumen and probably by additional negative allosteric mechanisms by interacting
      with a series of non-luminal sites.

TI  - Noribogaine reduces nicotine self-administration in rats.
PG  - 704-11
LID - 10.1177/0269881115584461 [doi]
AB  - Noribogaine, a polypharmacological drug with activities at opioid receptors,
      ionotropic nicotinic receptors, and serotonin reuptake transporters, has been
      investigated for treatment of substance abuse-related disorders. Smoking
      cessation has major benefits for both individuals and society, therefore the aim 
      of this study was to evaluate the potential of noribogaine for use as a treatment
      for nicotine dependence. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to
      self-administer nicotine intravenous. After initial food pellet training,
      followed by 26 sessions of nicotine self-administration training, the rats were
      administered noribogaine (12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg orally), noribogaine vehicle,
      varenicline or saline using a within-subject design with a Latin square test
      schedule. Noribogaine dose-dependently decreased nicotine self-administration by 
      up to 64% of saline-treated rats' levels and was equi-effective to 1.7 mg/kg
      intraperitoneal varenicline. Noribogaine was less efficient at reducing food
      pellets self-administration than at nicotine self-administration, inhibiting the 
      nondrug reinforcing effects of palatable pellets by 23% at the highest dose.
      These results suggest that noribogaine dose-dependently attenuates drug-taking
      behavior for nicotine, attenuates the reinforcing effects of nicotine and is
      comparable to varenicline power in that regard. The findings from the present
      study hold promise for a new therapy to aid smoking cessation.

TI  - Mania following use of ibogaine: A case series.
PG  - 203-5
LID - 10.1111/ajad.12209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibogaine is a naturally occurring hallucinogen with postulated
      anti-addictive qualities. While illegal domestically, a growing number of
      individuals have sought it out for treatment of opiate dependence, primarily in
      poorly regulated overseas clinics. Existing serious adverse events include
      cardiac and vestibular toxicity, though ours is the first report of mania
      stemming from its use. OBJECTIVES: To report on a case series of psychiatric
      emergency room patients whose unregulated use of ibogaine resulted in mania in
      three patients with no prior diagnosis of bipolar illness. METHODS: Review and
      summarize charts of three cases. Relevant literature was also reviewed for
      discussion. RESULTS: Two cases of reported ibogaine ingestion for self-treatment 
      of addictions, and one for psycho-spiritual experimentation resulted in symptoms 
      consistent with mania. No prior reports of mania were found in the literature,
      and the literature suggests growing popularity of ibogaine's use. CONCLUSIONS:
      The three cases presented demonstrate a temporal association between ibogaine
      ingestion and subsequent development of mania. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: In light 
      of these cases, clinicians faced with a new onset mania may benefit from careful 
      substance use and treatment history, specifically regarding opiates. In the
      vulnerable and often desperate addiction population, in particular, the number of
      patients seeking this treatment appears to be growing. We advise clinicians to be
      prepared for discussing the safety, efficacy, and paucity of good data regarding 
      ibogaine with patients who may be considering its use. (Am J Addict

AB  - UNLABELLED: Ibogaine, a psychotropic indole alkaloid, is gaining popularity among
      medical subcultures for its purported anti addictive properties. Its use has been
      associated with altered mental status, ataxia, gastrointestinal distress,
      ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden and unexplained deaths.Its pharmacokinetics
      in toxic states is not well understood. Case report:A 33-year-old man overdosed
      on ibogaine in an attempt to quit his use of heroin. He developed altered state
      of consciousness, tremor, ataxia,nausea, vomiting, and transient QT interval
      prolongation, which all remitted as he cleared the substance. Ibogaine was
      confirmed in his urine and serum with a peak serum concentration of 377 ng/mL.
      Nonlinear elimination kinetics and a formula match to its active metabolite
      noriobgaine were observed as well. CONCLUSION: This case presents the unique
      description of serial serum concentrations as well as urine and product-confirmed
      ibogaine toxicity with transient toxin-related QT interval prolongation.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ibogaine is a naturally occurring alkaloid with
      psychotropic and metabotropic effects, derived from the bark of the root of the
      West African Tabernanthe iboga plant. The tribes of Kongo basin have been using
      iboga as a stimulant, for medicinal purposes, and in rite of passage ceremonies, 
      for centuries. Besides, it has been found that this drug has anti-addictive
      effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: Previous studies have demonstrated that ibogaine
      changed the quantity of ATP and energy related enzymes as well as the activity of
      antioxidant enzymes in cells thus altering redox equilibrium in a time manner. In
      this work, the mechanism of its action was further studied by measuring the
      effects of ibogaine in human erythrocytes in vitro on ATP liberation, membrane
      fluidity and antioxidant enzymes activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heparinized
      human blood samples were incubated with ibogaine (10 and 20 muM) at 37 degrees C 
      for 1h. Blood plasma was separated by centrifugation and the levels of ATP and
      uric acid were measured 10 min after the addition of ibogaine using standard
      kits. The activity of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT),
      glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in
      erythrocytes after incubation period. The stability of SOD1 activity was further 
      tested through in vitro incubation with H2O2 and scanning of its electrophoretic 
      profiles. Membrane fluidity was determined using an electron paramagnetic
      resonance spin-labelling method. RESULTS: Results showed that ibogaine treatment 
      of erythrocytes in vitro increased ATP concentration in the blood plasma without 
      changes in neither erythrocytes membrane fluidity nor uric acid concentration.
      Ibogaine also increased SOD1 activity in erythrocytes at both doses applied here.
      Treatment with 20 muM also elevated GR activity after in vitro incubation at 37
      degrees C. Electrophoretic profiles revealed that incubation with ibogaine
      mitigates H2O2 mediated suppression of SOD1 activity. CONCLUSION: Some of the
      effects of ibogaine seem to be mediated through its influence on energy
      metabolism, redox active processes and the effects of discrete fluctuations of
      individual reactive oxygen species on different levels of enzyme activities.
      Overall, ibogaine acts as a pro-antioxidant by increasing activity of
      antioxidative enzymes and as an adaptagene in oxidative distress.

TI  - Influence of CYP2D6 activity on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a
      single 20 mg dose of ibogaine in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 680-7
LID - 10.1002/jcph.471 [doi]
AB  - Conversion of ibogaine to its active metabolite noribogaine appears to be
      mediated primarily by CYP2D6. We compared 168 hours pharmacokinetic profiles of
      both analytes after a single oral 20 mg dose of ibogaine in 21 healthy subjects
      who had been pretreated for 6 days with placebo or the CYP2D6 inhibitor
      paroxetine. In placebo-pretreated subjects, ibogaine was rapidly converted to
      noribogaine. Median peak noribogaine concentrations occurred at 4 hours. Compared
      with placebo-pretreated subjects, paroxetine-pretreated subjects had rapid (Tmax 
      = 1.5 hours) and substantial absorption of ibogaine, with detectable levels out
      to 72 hours, and an elimination half-life of 10.2 hours. In this group, ibogaine 
      was also rapidly converted to noribogaine with a median Tmax of 3 hours. Extent
      of noribogaine exposure was similar in both groups. CYP2D6 phenotype was robustly
      correlated with ibogaine AUC0-t (r = 0.82) and Cmax (r = 0.77). Active moiety
      (ibogaine plus noribogaine) exposure was approximately 2-fold higher in
      paroxetine-pretreated subjects. Single 20 mg ibogaine doses were safe and well
      tolerated in all subjects. The doubling of exposure to active moiety in subjects 
      with reduced CYP2D6 activity suggests it may be prudent to genotype patients
      awaiting ibogaine treatment, and to at least halve the intended dose of ibogaine 
      in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

TI  - The anti-addiction drug ibogaine and the heart: a delicate relation.
PG  - 2208-28
LID - 10.3390/molecules20022208 [doi]
AB  - The plant indole alkaloid ibogaine has shown promising anti-addictive properties 
      in animal studies. Ibogaine is also anti-addictive in humans as the drug
      alleviates drug craving and impedes relapse of drug use. Although not licensed as
      therapeutic drug and despite safety concerns, ibogaine is currently used as an
      anti-addiction medication in alternative medicine in dozens of clinics worldwide.
      In recent years, alarming reports of life-threatening complications and sudden
      death cases, temporally associated with the administration of ibogaine, have been
      accumulating. These adverse reactions were hypothesised to be associated with
      ibogaine's propensity to induce cardiac arrhythmias. The aim of this review is to
      recapitulate the current knowledge about ibogaine's effects on the heart and the 
      cardiovascular system, and to assess the cardiac risks associated with the use of
      this drug in anti- addiction therapy. The actions of 18-methoxycoronaridine
      (18-MC), a less toxic ibogaine congener with anti-addictive properties, are also 
      considered.

TI  - hERG Blockade by Iboga Alkaloids.
PG  - 14-22
LID - 10.1007/s12012-015-9311-5 [doi]
AB  - The iboga alkaloids are a class of naturally occurring and synthetic compounds,
      some of which modify drug self-administration and withdrawal in humans and
      preclinical models. Ibogaine, the prototypic iboga alkaloid that is utilized
      clinically to treat addictions, has been associated with QT prolongation,
      torsades de pointes and fatalities. hERG blockade as IKr was measured using the
      whole-cell patch clamp technique in HEK 293 cells. This yielded the following
      IC50 values: ibogaine manufactured by semisynthesis via voacangine (4.09 +/- 0.69
      microM) or by extraction from T. iboga (3.53 +/- 0.16 microM); ibogaine's
      principal metabolite noribogaine (2.86 +/- 0.68 microM); and voacangine (2.25 +/-
      0.34 microM). In contrast, the IC50 of 18-methoxycoronaridine, a product of
      rational synthesis and current focus of drug development was >50 microM. hERG
      blockade was voltage dependent for all of the compounds, consistent with
      low-affinity blockade. hERG channel binding affinities (K i) for the entire set
      of compounds, including 18-MC, ranged from 0.71 to 3.89 microM, suggesting that
      18-MC binds to the hERG channel with affinity similar to the other compounds, but
      the interaction produces substantially less hERG blockade. In view of the
      extended half-life of noribogaine, these results may relate to observations of
      persistent QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmia at delayed intervals of days
      following ibogaine ingestion. The apparent structure-activity relationships
      regarding positions of substitutions on the ibogamine skeleton suggest that the
      iboga alkaloids might provide an informative paradigm for investigation of the
      structural biology of the hERG channel.

TI  - Psychedelics as medicines for substance abuse rehabilitation: evaluating
      treatments with LSD, Peyote, Ibogaine and Ayahuasca.
PG  - 101-16
AB  - Substances known as psychedelics, hallucinogens and entheogens have been employed
      in ethnomedical traditions for thousands of years, but after promising uses in
      the 1950's and 1960's they were largely prohibited in medical treatment and human
      research starting in the 1970's as part of the fallout from the war on drugs.
      Nonetheless, there are a number of studies which suggest that these substances
      have potential applications in the treatment of addictions. While these
      substances are generally classified as Schedule I, alleging no established
      medical uses and a high drug abuse potential, there is nonetheless evidence
      indicating they might be safe and effective tools for short term interventions in
      addictions treatment. Evidence suggests that the psychedelics have a much greater
      safety profile than the major addictive drugs, having extremely low levels of
      mortality, and producing little if any physical dependence. This paper reviews
      studies evaluating the use of LSD, peyote, ibogaine and ayahuasca in the
      treatment of dependencies and the possible mechanisms underlying the indications 
      of effectiveness. Evidence suggests that these substances help assist recovery
      from drug dependency through a variety of therapeutic mechanisms, including a
      notable "after-glow" effect that in part reflects their action on the serotonin
      neurotransmitter system. Serotonin has been long recognized as central to the
      psychedelics' well-known phenomenological, physical, emotional and cognitive
      dynamics. These serotonin-based dynamics are directly relevant to treatment of
      addiction because of depressed serotonin levels found in addict populations, as
      well as the role of serotonin as a neuromodulators affecting many other
      neurotransmitter systems.

AB  - After a 40-year hiatus there is now a revisiting of psychedelic drug therapy
      throughout psychiatry, with studies examining the drugs psilocybin, ketamine,
      ibogaine and ayahuasca in the treatment of drug dependence. Limitations to these 
      therapies are both clinical and legal, but the possibility of improving outcomes 
      for patients with substance dependency imposes an obligation to research this
      area.

AB  - Plant poisonings have left their mark on history and still cause many deaths,
      whether intentional or accidental. The means to show toxicological evidence of
      such poisonings should be implemented with great care. This article presents a
      technique for measuring thirty-nine toxic principles of plant origin in the
      blood, covering a large amount of toxins from local or exotic plants:
      alpha-lobeline, alpha-solanine, aconitine, ajmaline, atropine, brucine,
      cephalomannine, colchicine, convallatoxin, cymarine, cytisine, digitoxin,
      digoxin, emetine, gelsemine, ibogaine, jervine, kavain, lanatoside C, lupanine,
      mitragynine, neriifolin, oleandrin, ouabain, paclitaxel, physostigmine,
      pilocarpine, podophyllotoxin, proscillaridin A, reserpine, retrorsine, ricinine, 
      scopolamine, senecionine, sparteine, strophanthidin, strychnine, veratridine and 
      yohimbine. Analysis was carried out using an original ultra-high performance
      liquid chromatography separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection.
      Extraction was a standard solid phase extraction performed on Oasis((R)) HLB
      cartridge. Thirty-four of the thirty-nine compounds were put through a validation
      procedure. The assay was linear in the calibration curve range from 0.5 or 5
      mug/L to 1000 mug/L according to the compounds. The method is sensitive (LOD from
      0.1 to 1.6 mug/L). The within-day precision of the assay was less than 22.5% at
      the LLOQ, and the between-day precision was less than 21.5% for 10 mug/L for all 
      the compounds included. The assay accuracy was in the range of 87.4 to 119.8% for
      the LLOQ. The extraction recovery and matrix effect ranged from 30 to 106% and
      from -30 to 14%, respectively. It has proven useful and effective in several
      difficult forensic cases.

      pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability.
PG  - 189-94
LID - 10.1002/jcph.404 [doi]
AB  - Noribogaine is the active metabolite of the naturally occurring psychoactive
      substance ibogaine, and may help suppress withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent
      subjects. The objectives of this Phase I study were to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of noribogaine. In
      this ascending single-dose, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group study in 36 healthy drug-free male volunteers, 4 cohorts (n = 9)
      received oral doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg or matching placebo, with intensive
      safety and pharmacokinetic assessments out to 216 hours, along with
      pharmacodynamic assessments sensitive to the effects of mu-opioid agonists.
      Noribogaine was rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations occurring 2-3 hours
      after oral dosing, and showed dose-linear increases of area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax between 3 and 60 mg. The drug was slowly 
      eliminated, with mean half-life estimates of 28-49 hours across dose groups.
      Apparent volume of distribution was high (mean 1417-3086 L across dose groups).
      No safety or tolerability issues were identified in any cohort. No mu-opioid
      agonist pharmacodynamic effects were noted in pupillometry or cold-pressor
      testing. Single oral doses of noribogaine 3-60 mg were safe and well tolerated in
      healthy volunteers.

TI  - Treating drug dependence with the aid of ibogaine: a retrospective study.
PG  - 993-1000
LID - 10.1177/0269881114552713 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine is an alkaloid purported to be an effective drug dependence treatment.
      However, its efficacy has been hard to evaluate, partly because it is illegal in 
      some countries. In such places, treatments are conducted in underground settings 
      where fatalities have occurred. In Brazil ibogaine is unregulated and a combined 
      approach of psychotherapy and ibogaine is being practiced to treat addiction. To 
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibogaine, we conducted a retrospective
      analysis of data from 75 previous alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and crack users (72%
      poly-drug users). We observed no serious adverse reactions or fatalities, and
      found 61% of participants abstinent. Participants treated with ibogaine only once
      reported abstinence for a median of 5.5 months and those treated multiple times
      for a median of 8.4 months. This increase was statistically significant (p <
      0.001), and both single or multiple treatments led to longer abstinence periods
      than before the first ibogaine session (p < 0.001). These results suggest that
      the use of ibogaine supervised by a physician and accompanied by psychotherapy
      can facilitate prolonged periods of abstinence, without the occurrence of
      fatalities or complications. These results suggest that ibogaine can be a safe
      and effective treatment for dependence on stimulant and other non-opiate drugs.

TI  - A cytosolic relay of heat shock proteins HSP70-1A and HSP90beta monitors the
      folding trajectory of the serotonin transporter.
PG  - 28987-9000
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.595090 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the C terminus of the serotonin transporter (SERT) disrupt folding
      and export from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we examined the hypothesis that a
      cytosolic heat shock protein relay was recruited to the C terminus to assist
      folding of SERT. This conjecture was verified by the following observations. (i) 
      The proximal portion of the SERT C terminus conforms to a canonical binding site 
      for DnaK/heat shock protein of 70 kDa (HSP70). A peptide covering this segment
      stimulated ATPase activity of purified HSP70-1A. (ii) A GST fusion protein
      comprising the C terminus of SERT pulled down HSP70-1A. The interaction between
      HSP70-1A and SERT was visualized in live cells by Forster resonance energy
      transfer: it was restricted to endoplasmic reticulum-resident transporters and
      enhanced by an inhibitor that traps HSP70-1A in its closed state. (iv)
      Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed complex formation of SERT with HSP70-1A and
      HSP90beta. Consistent with an HSP relay, co-chaperones (e.g.
      HSC70-HSP90-organizing protein) were co-immunoprecipitated with the stalled
      mutants SERT-R607A/I608A and SERT-P601A/G602A. (v) Depletion of HSP90beta by
      siRNA or its inhibition increased the cell surface expression of wild type SERT
      and SERT-F604Q. In contrast, SERT-R607A/I608A and SERT-P601A/G602A were only
      rendered susceptible to inhibition of HSP70 and HSP90 by concomitant
      pharmacochaperoning with noribogaine. (vi) In JAR cells, inhibition of HSP90 also
      increased the levels of SERT, indicating that endogenously expressed transporter 
      was also susceptible to control by HSP90beta. These findings support the concept 
      that the folding trajectory of SERT is sampled by a cytoplasmic chaperone relay.

TI  - Iboga-Type Alkaloids from Ervatamia officinalis.
PG  - 1839-46
LID - 10.1021/np500240b [doi]
AB  - Seven new iboga-type alkaloids, ervaoffines A-D (1-4), (7S)-3-oxoibogaine
      hydroxyindolenine (5), ibogaine-5,6-dione (6), and 19-epi-5-oxovoacristine (7),
      and 10 known alkaloids were isolated from Ervatamia officinalis. The absolute
      configurations of 1-7 were determined through X-ray diffraction and electronic
      circular dichroism (ECD) analyses. Ervaoffines A and B represent the first
      iboga-type pseudoindoxyl alkaloids in which the C-2 spiro carbon configuration is
      opposite to that of other members of this class, such as iboluteine (8). The
      relationship between the absolute configuration of the spiro carbons and the
      Cotton effect in the ECD spectrum is established for the first time for
      iboga-type pseudoindoxyl and oxindole alkaloids. Additionally, a plausible
      biogenetic pathway for these alkaloids is proposed.

TI  - Identification of Indole Alkaloid Structural Units Important for
      Stimulus-Selective TRPM8 Inhibition: SAR Study of Naturally Occurring Iboga
      Derivatives.
PG  - 1831-8
LID - 10.1021/np500235b [doi]
AB  - The iboga alkaloid voacangine (1) has been reported previously to be the first
      stimulus-selective TRPM8 antagonist. In the present report, a structure-activity 
      relationship (SAR) study is described on the effects of some naturally occurring 
      indole alkaloid analogues on TRPM8 inhibition. Dihydrocatharanthine (10) and
      catharanthine (11) were found to be inhibitors of TRPM8 activity, and their IC50 
      values were equivalent to that of BCTC, a potent and representative TRPM8
      antagonist. Furthermore, it was shown that the iboga moiety is the most crucial
      unit for TRPM8 blockade and that its stereostructure, as found in 1 but not in 10
      and 11, is essential for chemical agonist-selective TRPM8 inhibition. These
      findings should provide useful information for synthesizing additional
      stimulus-selective and TRPM8-selective blockers.

AB  - Natural product modification with photoredox catalysis allows for mild,
      chemoselective access to a wide array of related structures in complex areas of
      chemical space, providing the possibility for novel structural motifs as well as 
      useful quantities of less abundant congeners. While amine additives have been
      used extensively as stoichiometric electron donors for photocatalysis, the
      controlled modification of amine substrates through single-electron oxidation is 
      ideal for the synthesis and modification of alkaloids. Here, we report the
      conversion of the amine (+)-catharanthine into the natural products
      (-)-pseudotabersonine, (-)-pseudovincadifformine, and (+)-coronaridine utilizing 
      visible light photoredox catalysis.

TI  - Screening and identification of neuroprotective compounds relevant to Alzheimers 
      disease from medicinal plants of S. Tome e Principe.

LID - S0378-8741(14)00494-2 [pii]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimers disease (AD) neuropathology is
      strongly associated with the activation of inflammatory pathways, and long-term
      use of anti-inflammatory drugs reduces the risk of developing the disease. In S. 
      Tome e Principe (STP), several medicinal plants are used both for their positive 
      effects in the nervous system (treatment of mental disorders, analgesics) and
      their anti-inflammatory properties. The goal of this study was to determine
      whether a phenotypic, cell-based screening approach can be applied to selected
      plants from STP (Voacanga africana, Tarenna nitiduloides, Sacosperma paniculatum,
      Psychotria principensis, Psychotria subobliqua) in order to identify natural
      compounds with multiple biological activities of interest for AD therapeutics.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant hydroethanolic extracts were prepared and tested in 
      a panel of phenotypic screening assays that reflect multiple neurotoxicity
      pathways relevant to AD-oxytosis in hippocampal nerve cells, in vitro ischemia,
      intracellular amyloid toxicity, inhibition of microglial inflammation and nerve
      cell differentiation. HPLC fractions from the extract that performed the best in 
      all of the assays were tested in the oxytosis assay, our primary screen, and the 
      most protective fraction was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The predominant
      compound was purified, its identity confirmed by ESI mass spectrometry and NMR,
      and then tested in all of the screening assays to determine its efficacy.
      RESULTS: An extract from the bark of Voacanga africana was more protective than
      any other plant extract in all of the assays (EC50s</=2.4 microg/mL). The HPLC
      fraction from the extract that was most protective against oxytosis contained the
      alkaloid voacamine (MW=704.90) as the predominant compound. Purified voacamine
      was very protective at low doses in all of the assays (EC50s</=3.4 microM).
      CONCLUSION: These findings validate the use of our phenotypic screening,
      cell-based assays to identify potential compounds to treat AD from plant extracts
      with ethnopharmacological relevance. Our study identifies the alkaloid voacamine 
      as a major compound in Voacanga africana with potent neuroprotective activities
      in these assays.

      century A.D.).

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Food is medicine and vice versa. In Hindu and
      Ayurvedic medicine, and among human cultures of the Indian subcontinent in
      general, the perception of the food-medicine continuum is especially well
      established. The preparation of the exhilarating, gold-coloured Soma, Amrita or
      Ambrosia, the elixir and food of the 'immortals'-the Hindu pantheon-by the
      ancient Indo-Aryans, is described in the Rigveda in poetic hymns. Different
      theories regarding the botanical identity of Soma circulate, but no
      pharmacologically and historically convincing theory exists to date. We intend to
      contribute to the botanical, chemical and pharmacological characterisation of
      Soma through an analysis of two historical Amrita recipes recorded in the Bower
      Manuscript. The recipes are referred therein as panaceas (clarified butter) and
      also as a medicine to treat nervous diseases (oil), while no exhilarating
      properties are mentioned. Notwithstanding this, we hypothesise, that these
      recipes are related to the ca. 1800 years older Rigvedic Soma. We suppose that
      the psychoactive Soma ingredient(s) are among the components, possibly in smaller
      proportions, of the Amrita recipes preserved in the Bower Manuscript. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: The Bower Manuscript is a medical treatise recorded in the 6th
      century A.D. in Sanskrit on birch bark leaves, probably by Buddhist monks, and
      unearthed towards the end of the 19th century in Chinese Turkestan. We analysed
      two Amrita recipes from the Bower Manuscript, which was translated by Rudolf
      Hoernle into English during the early 20th century. A database search with the
      updated Latin binomials of the herbal ingredients was used to gather quantitative
      phytochemical and pharmacological information. RESULTS: Together, both Amrita
      recipes contain around 100 herbal ingredients. Psychoactive alkaloid containing
      species still important in Ayurvedic, Chinese and Thai medicine and mentioned in 
      the recipe for 'Amrita-Prasa clarified butter' and 'Amrita Oil' are: Tinospora
      cordifolia (Amrita, Guduchi), three Sida spp., Mucuna pruriens, Nelumbo nucifera,
      Desmodium gangeticum, and Tabernaemontana divaricata. These species contain
      several notorious and potential psychoactive and psychedelic alkaloids, namely:
      tryptamines, 2-phenylethylamine, ephedrine, aporphines, ibogaine, and L-DOPA.
      Furthermore, protoberberine alkaloids, tetrahydro-beta-carbolines, and
      tetrahydroisoquinolines with monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I) activity but
      also neurotoxic properties are reported. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that Soma was a 
      combination of a protoberberine alkaloids containing Tinospora cordifolia juice
      with MAO-I properties mixed together with a tryptamine rich Desmodium gangeticum 
      extract or a blending of Tinospora cordifolia with an ephedrine and
      phenylethylamine-rich Sida spp. extract. Tinospora cordifolia combined with
      Desmodium gangeticum might provide a psychedelic experience with visual effects, 
      while a combination of Tinospora cordifolia with Sida spp. might lead to more
      euphoric and amphetamine-like experiences.

TI  - History and future of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies
      (MAPS).
PG  - 27-36
AB  - This article describes the teenage vision of the founder of the Multidisciplinary
      Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) that humanity's future would be aided 
      by the therapeutic and spiritual potential of psychedelic substances. The article
      traces the trajectory of MAPS from inception in 1986 to its present, noting
      future goals with respect to research, outreach, and harm reduction. MAPS was
      created as a non-profit psychedelic pharmaceutical company in response to the
      1985 scheduling of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Overcoming many
      hurdles, MAPS developed the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and plans
      for FDA prescription approval in 2021. MAPS' program of research expanded to
      include a trial of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-assisted psychotherapy for
      anxiety when facing life-threatening illness, observational studies of ibogaine
      in the treatment of addiction, and studies of MDMA for social anxiety in people
      with autism spectrum disorders. MAPS meets the challenges of drug development
      through a clinical research team led by a former Novartis drug development
      professional experienced in the conduct, monitoring, and analysis of clinical
      trials. MAPS' harm-reduction efforts are intended to avoid backlash and build a
      post-prohibition world by assisting non-medical users to transform difficult
      psychedelic experiences into opportunities for growth.

      melanoma cells and does not induce toxicity in normal fibroblasts.
PG  - 855-62
LID - 10.1021/np400950h [doi]
AB  - In previous studies it has been demonstrated that the plant alkaloid voacamine
      (1), used at noncytotoxic concentrations, enhanced the cytotoxicity of
      doxorubicin and exerted a chemosensitizing effect on cultured multidrug-resistant
      (MDR) U-2 OS-DX osteosarcoma cells. The in vitro investigations reported herein
      gave the following results: (i) the chemosensitizing effect of 1, in terms of
      drug accumulation and cell survival, was confirmed using SAOS-2-DX cells, another
      MDR osteosarcoma cell line; (ii) compound 1 enhanced the cytotoxic effect of
      doxorubicin also on the melanoma cell line Me30966, intrinsically drug resistant 
      and P-glycoprotein-negative; (iii) at the concentrations used to sensitize tumor 
      cells, 1 was not cytotoxic to normal cells (human fibroblasts). These findings
      suggest possible applications of voacamine (1) in integrative oncologic therapies
      against resistant tumors.

TI  - Activation and inhibition of thermosensitive TRP channels by voacangine, an
      alkaloid present in Voacanga africana, an African tree.
PG  - 285-97
LID - 10.1021/np400885u [doi]
AB  - Voacangine (1) is an alkaloid found in the root bark of Voacanga africana. Our
      previous work has suggested that 1 is a novel transient receptor potential
      vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) antagonist. In this study, the agonist and antagonist
      activities of 1 were examined against thermosensitive TRP channels. Channel
      activity was evaluated mainly using TRP channel-expressing HEK cells and calcium 
      imaging. Herein, it was shown that 1 acts as an antagonist for TRPV1 and TRPM8
      but as an agonist for TRPA1 (EC50, 8 muM). The compound competitively blocked
      capsaicin binding to TRPV1 (IC50, 50 muM). Voacangine (1) competitively inhibited
      the binding of menthol to TRPM8 (IC50, 9 muM), but it showed noncompetitive
      inhibition against icilin (IC50, 7 muM). Moreover, the compound selectively
      abrogated chemical agonist-induced TRPM8 activation and did not affect
      cold-induced activation. Among these effects, the TRPM8 inhibition profile is
      unique and noteworthy, because to date no studies have reported a menthol
      competitive inhibitor of TRPM8 derived from a natural source. Furthermore, this
      is the first report of a stimulus-selective TRPM8 antagonist. Accordingly, 1 may 
      contribute to the development of a novel class of stimulus-selective TRPM8
      blockers.

TI  - Mechanism of hERG channel block by the psychoactive indole alkaloid ibogaine.
PG  - 346-58
LID - 10.1124/jpet.113.209643 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine is a psychoactive indole alkaloid. Its use as an antiaddictive agent has
      been accompanied by QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, which are most
      likely caused by human ether a go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel
      inhibition. Therefore, we studied in detail the interaction of ibogaine with hERG
      channels heterologously expressed in mammalian kidney tsA-201 cells. Currents
      through hERG channels were blocked regardless of whether ibogaine was applied via
      the extracellular or intracellular solution. The extent of inhibition was
      determined by the relative pH values. Block occurred during activation of the
      channels and was not observed for resting channels. With increasing
      depolarizations, ibogaine block grew and developed faster. Steady-state
      activation and inactivation of the channel were shifted to more negative
      potentials. Deactivation was slowed, whereas inactivation was accelerated.
      Mutations in the binding site reported for other hERG channel blockers (Y652A and
      F656A) reduced the potency of ibogaine, whereas an inactivation-deficient double 
      mutant (G628C/S631C) was as sensitive as wild-type channels. Molecular drug
      docking indicated binding within the inner cavity of the channel independently of
      the protonation of ibogaine. Experimental current traces were fit to a kinetic
      model of hERG channel gating, revealing preferential binding of ibogaine to the
      open and inactivated state. Taken together, these findings show that ibogaine
      blocks hERG channels from the cytosolic side either in its charged form alone or 
      in company with its uncharged form and alters the currents by changing the
      relative contribution of channel states over time.

PG  - e77262
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0077262 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The iboga alkaloids are a class of small molecules defined
      structurally on the basis of a common ibogamine skeleton, some of which modify
      opioid withdrawal and drug self-administration in humans and preclinical models. 
      These compounds may represent an innovative approach to neurobiological
      investigation and development of addiction pharmacotherapy. In particular, the
      use of the prototypic iboga alkaloid ibogaine for opioid detoxification in humans
      raises the question of whether its effect is mediated by an opioid agonist
      action, or if it represents alternative and possibly novel mechanism of action.
      The aim of this study was to independently replicate and extend evidence
      regarding the activation of mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-related G proteins by iboga 
      alkaloids. METHODS: Ibogaine, its major metabolite noribogaine, and
      18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a synthetic congener, were evaluated by
      agonist-stimulated guanosine-5 -O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS)
      binding in cells overexpressing the recombinant MOR, in rat thalamic membranes,
      and autoradiography in rat brain slices. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: In rat
      thalamic membranes ibogaine, noribogaine and 18-MC were MOR antagonists with
      functional Ke values ranging from 3 uM (ibogaine) to 13 uM (noribogaine and
      18MC). Noribogaine and 18-MC did not stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in
      Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human or rat MORs, and had only limited
      partial agonist effects in human embryonic kidney cells expressing mouse MORs.
      Ibogaine did not did not stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in any MOR expressing
      cells. Noribogaine did not stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in brain slices
      using autoradiography. An MOR agonist action does not appear to account for the
      effect of these iboga alkaloids on opioid withdrawal. Taken together with
      existing evidence that their mechanism of action also differs from that of other 
      non-opioids with clinical effects on opioid tolerance and withdrawal, these
      findings suggest a novel mechanism of action, and further justify the search for 
      alternative targets of iboga alkaloids.

TI  - A qualitative/quantitative approach for the detection of 37 tryptamine-derived
      designer drugs, 5 beta-carbolines, ibogaine, and yohimbine in human urine and
      plasma using standard urine screening and multi-analyte approaches.

AB  - The first synthetic tryptamines have entered the designer drug market in the late
      1990s and were distributed as psychedelic recreational drugs. In the meantime,
      several analogs have been brought onto the market indicating a growing interest
      in this drug class. So far, only scarce analytical data were available on the
      detectability of tryptamines in human biosamples. Therefore, the aim of the
      presented study was the development and full validation of a method for their
      detection in human urine and plasma and their quantification in human plasma. The
      liquid chromatography-linear ion trap mass spectrometry method presented covered 
      37 tryptamines as well as five beta-carbolines, ibogaine, and yohimbine.
      Compounds were analyzed after protein precipitation of urine or fast
      liquid-liquid extraction of plasma using an LXQ linear ion trap coupled to an
      Accela ultra ultra high-performance liquid chromatography system. Data mining was
      performed via information-dependent acquisition or targeted product ion scan mode
      with positive electrospray ionization. The assay was selective for all tested
      substances with limits of detection in urine between 10 and 100 ng/mL and in
      plasma between 1 and 100 ng/mL. A validated quantification in plasma according to
      international recommendation could be demonstrated for 33 out of 44 analytes.

AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring alkaloid derived from the roots of the rain
      forest shrub Tabernanthe iboga. Deaths have occurred temporarily related to the
      use of ibogaine. However, although not licensed as therapeutic drug, and despite 
      evidence that ibogaine may disturb the rhythm of the heart, this alkaloid is
      currently used as an anti-addiction drug in alternative medicine for
      detoxification purposes. We report the case of a man who died suddenly 12-24 h
      after ibogaine use for alcohol detoxification treatment. In the autopsy liver
      cirrhosis and heavy fatty infiltration was found. The concentration of ibogaine
      was 2 mg/l. The potential risks of ibogaine use, especially for persons with
      pathological medical background, are discussed.

AB  - We report the case of a man who died twelve hours after ingesting powdered iboga 
      root, commonly taken for its stimulant and hallucinogenic properties. Ibogaine
      and ibogamine were quantified in the powder ingested and the victim's body fluids
      by GC-MS/MS after liquid-liquid extraction (Toxi-tubes A((R))). The
      concentrations of ibogaine measured in the blood samples taken at the scene and
      in the peripheral blood, urine, and gastric fluid samples taken during the
      autopsy were 0.65, 1.27, 1.7, and 53.5 mug/mL, while the iboga content in the
      powder was 7.2%. Moreover, systematic toxicological analyses of biological
      samples showed the presence of diazepam and methadone in therapeutic
      concentrations. Death was attributed to the ingestion of a substantial quantity
      of iboga in the context of simultaneous methadone and diazepam consumption.

      by molecular dynamics simulations.
PG  - e63635
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0063635 [doi]
AB  - The competitive inhibitor cocaine and the non-competitive inhibitor ibogaine
      induce different conformational states of the human serotonin transporter. It has
      been shown from accessibility experiments that cocaine mainly induces an
      outward-facing conformation, while the non-competitive inhibitor ibogaine, and
      its active metabolite noribogaine, have been proposed to induce an inward-facing 
      conformation of the human serotonin transporter similar to what has been observed
      for the endogenous substrate, serotonin. The ligand induced conformational
      changes within the human serotonin transporter caused by these three different
      types of ligands, substrate, non-competitive and competitive inhibitors, are
      studied from multiple atomistic molecular dynamics simulations initiated from a
      homology model of the human serotonin transporter. The results reveal that
      diverse conformations of the human serotonin transporter are captured from the
      molecular dynamics simulations depending on the type of the ligand bound. The
      inward-facing conformation of the human serotonin transporter is reached with
      noribogaine bound, and this state resembles a previously identified inward-facing
      conformation of the human serotonin transporter obtained from molecular dynamics 
      simulation with bound substrate, but also a recently published inward-facing
      conformation of a bacterial homolog, the leucine transporter from Aquifex
      Aoelicus. The differences observed in ligand induced behavior are found to
      originate from different interaction patterns between the ligands and the
      protein. Such atomic-level understanding of how an inhibitor can dictate the
      conformational response of a transporter by ligand binding may be of great
      importance for future drug design.

      assess the drug's cardiac ion channel profile.

AB  - The plant alkaloid ibogaine has promising anti-addictive properties. Albeit not
      licensed as a therapeutic drug, and despite hints that ibogaine may perturb the
      heart rhythm, this alkaloid is used to treat drug addicts. We have recently
      reported that ibogaine inhibits human ERG (hERG) potassium channels at
      concentrations similar to the drugs affinity for several of its known brain
      targets. Thereby the drug may disturb the heart's electrophysiology. Here, to
      assess the drug's cardiac ion channel profile in more detail, we studied the
      effects of ibogaine and its congener 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) on various
      cardiac voltage-gated ion channels. We confirmed that heterologously expressed
      hERG currents are reduced by ibogaine in low micromolar concentrations. Moreover,
      at higher concentrations, the drug also reduced human Nav1.5 sodium and Cav1.2
      calcium currents. Ion currents were as well reduced by 18-MC, yet with diminished
      potency. Unexpectedly, although blocking hERG channels, ibogaine did not prolong 
      the action potential (AP) in guinea pig cardiomyocytes at low micromolar
      concentrations. Higher concentrations (>/= 10 muM) even shortened the AP. These
      findings can be explained by the drug's calcium channel inhibition, which
      counteracts the AP-prolonging effect generated by hERG blockade. Implementation
      of ibogaine's inhibitory effects on human ion channels in a computer model of a
      ventricular cardiomyocyte, on the other hand, suggested that ibogaine does
      prolong the AP in the human heart. We conclude that therapeutic concentrations of
      ibogaine have the propensity to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram 
      in humans. In some cases this may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.

AB  - Structure determination of mammalian integral membrane proteins is challenging
      due to their instability upon detergent solubilisation and purification. Recent
      successes in the structure determination of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
      resulted from the development of GPCR-specific protein engineering strategies.
      One of these, conformational thermostabilisation, could in theory facilitate
      structure determination of other membrane proteins by improving their tolerance
      to detergents and locking them in a specific conformation. We have therefore used
      this approach on the cocaine-sensitive rat serotonin transporter (SERT). Out of a
      panel of 554 point mutants throughout SERT, 10 were found to improve its
      thermostability. The most stabilising mutations were combined to make the
      thermostabilised mutants SAH6 (L99A+G278A+A505L) and SAH7 (L405A+P499A+A505L)
      that were more stable than SERT by 18 degrees C and 16 degrees C, respectively.
      Inhibitor binding assays showed that both of the thermostabilised SERT mutants
      bound [(125)I]RTI55 (beta-CIT) with affinity similar to that of the wild-type
      transporter, although cocaine bound with increased affinity (17- to 56-fold)
      whilst ibogaine, imipramine and paroxetine all bound with lower affinity (up to
      90-fold). Neither SAH6 nor SAH7 was capable of transporting [(3)H]serotonin into 
      HEK293 cell lines stably expressing the mutants, although serotonin bound to them
      with an apparent Ki of 155muM or 82muM, respectively. These data combined suggest
      that SAH6 and SAH7 are thermostabilised in a specific cocaine-bound conformation,
      making them promising candidates for crystallisation. Conformational
      thermostabilisation is thus equally applicable to membrane proteins that are
      transporters in addition to those that are GPCRs.

TI  - Ibogaine in the treatment of substance dependence.
PG  - 3-16
AB  - Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid derived from Tabernanthe iboga, a plant used 
      in initiatory rituals in West Central Africa. Largely because of ibogaine's
      status as a Schedule I substance in the U.S., the development of ibogaine's use
      in the treatment of drug addiction took place outside conventional clinical and
      medical settings. This article reviews the history of ibogaine's use in the
      treatment of drug addiction, and discusses progress made towards, and obstacles
      blocking, the establishment of controlled clinical trials of ibogaine's efficacy.
      Preclinical research has generally supported anecdotal claims that ibogaine
      attenuates withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug cravings. Concerns about
      ibogaine's safety, as well as a dearth of solid data from human studies, have
      hampered progress in its development as an approved medication. This article
      outlines major findings from preclinical studies, discusses concerns about
      ibogaine's safety, and details previous and ongoing research on ibogaine's use as
      an anti-addictive treatment for humans.

AB  - Guided by the acetylcholinesterase inhibiting activity, the bisindole alkaloid
      3'-R/S-hydroxyvoacamine was isolated from a stem extract of Tabernaemontana
      divaricata, a plant used in Thailand in traditional rejuvenation remedies for
      improving the memory. The structure of the alkaloid was elucidated by extensive
      use of NMR spectroscopy and the complete assignment of the (1)H and (13)C NMR
      spectra is reported. The alkaloid acted as a non-competitive inhibitor against
      AChE with an IC50 value of 7.00+/-1.99 muM. An HPLC method was developed for the 
      quantitative analysis of the AChE inhibitor. It suggested that there was 12.4%
      (w/w) of 3'-R/S-hydroxyvoacamine in the alkaloid enriched fraction of T.
      divaricata stem.

TI  - Life-threatening complications of ibogaine: three case reports.
PG  - 422-4
AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive alkaloid extracted from the roots 
      of the Tabernanthe iboga plant, which in alternative medicine is used to treat
      drug dependency. However, this upcoming, online advocated therapy can be
      dangerous due to its potentially lethal adverse effects. We present three cases
      in which toxic side effects were noted. We used the Naranjo scale to estimate the
      probability of a causal relationship between these effects and ibogaine. Findings
      in these three cases are suggestive of a causal relationship between the use of
      ibogaine and serious respiratory and cardiac problems (including lengthening of
      the QT interval). In our opinion it is of great importance that clinicians are
      aware of these potentially serious side effects and realise that widespread
      online marketing practices will give many more people access to ibogaine.

AB  - An indole alkaloid, ibogaine is the principal psychoactive component of the iboga
      plant, used by indigenous peoples in West Africa for centuries. Modulating
      multiple neurotransmitter systems, the drug is a potent hallucinogen in humans,
      although its psychotropic effects remain poorly understood. Expanding the range
      of model species is an important strategy for translational neuroscience
      research. Here we exposed adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 10 and 20mg/L of
      ibogaine, testing them in the novel tank, light-dark box, open field, mirror
      stimulation, social preference and shoaling tests. In the novel tank test, the
      zebrafish natural diving response (geotaxis) was reversed by ibogaine, inducing
      initial top swimming followed by bottom dwelling. Ibogaine also attenuated the
      innate preference for dark environments (scototaxis) in the light-dark box test. 
      While it did not exert overt locomotor or thigmotaxic responses in the open field
      test, the drug altered spatiotemporal exploration of novel environment, inducing 
      clear preference of some areas over others. Ibogaine also promoted 'mirror'
      exploration in the mirror stimulation test, disrupted group cohesion in the
      shoaling test, and evoked strong coloration responses due to melanophore
      aggregation, but did not alter brain c-fos expression or whole-body cortisol
      levels. Overall, our results support the complex pharmacological profile of
      ibogaine and its high sensitivity in zebrafish models, dose-dependently affecting
      multiple behavioral domains. While future investigations in zebrafish may help
      elucidate the mechanisms underlying these unique behavioral effects, our study
      strongly supports the developing utility of aquatic models in hallucinogenic drug
      research. High sensitivity of three-dimensional phenotyping approaches applied
      here to behavioral effects of ibogaine in zebrafish provides further evidence of 
      how 3D reconstructions of zebrafish swimming paths may be useful for
      high-throughput pharmacological screening.

TI  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine blocks context-induced reinstatement following cocaine
      self-administration in rats.
PG  - 83-94
AB  - Numerous studies utilizing drug self-administration have shown the importance of 
      conditioned cues in maintaining and reinstating addictive behaviors. However,
      most used simple cues that fail to replicate the complexity of cues present in
      human craving and addiction. We have recently shown that music can induce
      behavioral and neurochemical changes in rats following classical conditioning
      with psychostimulants. However, such effects have yet to be characterized
      utilizing operant self-administration procedures, particularly with regard to
      craving and relapse. The goal of the present study was to validate the
      effectiveness of music as a contextual conditioned stimulus using cocaine in an
      operant reinstatement model of relapse. Rats were trained to lever press for
      cocaine with a musical cue, and were subsequently tested during reinstatement
      sessions to determine how musical conditioning affected drug seeking behavior.
      Additionally, in vivo microdialysis was used to determine basolateral amygdala
      involvement during reinstatement. Lastly, tests were conducted to determine
      whether the putative anti-addictive agent 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) could
      attenuate cue-induced drug seeking behavior. Our results show that
      music-conditioned animals exhibited increased drug seeking behaviors when
      compared to controls during reinstatement test sessions. Furthermore,
      music-conditioned subjects exhibited increased extracellular dopamine in the
      basolateral amygdala during reinstatement sessions. Perhaps most importantly,
      18-MC blocked musical cue-induced reinstatement. Thus,music can be a powerful
      contextual conditioned cue in rats, capable of inducing changes in both brain
      neurochemistry and drug seeking behavior during abstinence. The fact that 18-MC
      blocked cue-induced reinstatement suggests that alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors
      may be involved in the mechanism of craving, and that 18-MC may help prevent
      relapse to drug addiction in humans.

TI  - Metabolic plasticity and the energy economizing effect of ibogaine, the principal
      alkaloid of Tabernanthe iboga.
PG  - 319-24
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2012.06.039 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The root bark of iboga plant-Tabernanthe iboga
      has been used traditionally in Central Africa as a psychoactive substance in
      religious rituals, while in smaller doses it is appreciated due to its stimulant 
      properties. The iboga root bark, iboga extract or pure ibogaine are being
      recognized in the West as an anti-addiction remedy and their use is increasing.
      AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous studies have demonstrated a transient ATP pool
      reduction under ibogaine accompanied by the induction of energy metabolism
      related enzymes. The present study aimed to find the cause of this energy
      deprivation and to foresee its immediate and long-term impact on metabolism. The 
      overall project is designed to disclose the common mechanism of action at these
      seemingly diverse indications for iboga use, to predict eventual adverse effects 
      and to build the grounds for its safe and beneficial utilization. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The rate of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) as a marker of energy metabolism in
      stationary yeast model under aerobic conditions in the presence of ibogaine at
      concentration of 1, 4 and 20mg/l was measured for 5h by gas chromatography. The
      overall oxidative load was determined fluorimetrically by
      2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA) and in vitro antioxidant
      properties of ibogaine were defined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test.
      RESULTS: The CO(2) production under ibogaine was temporarily increased in a dose 
      dependent manner. The increased energy consumption as an early effect of ibogaine
      was proven by the fact that in spite of energy mobilization, the ATP pool has
      been simultaneously decreased. Although increased cellular respiration
      co-produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), the overall oxidative load was
      significantly lowered by ibogaine. Since ibogaine does not show any significant
      in vitro antioxidant properties, the results indicate its stimulating influence
      on physiological oxidative stress defence system. CONCLUSION: Ibogaine triggers
      remodeling of the housekeeping metabolism. Under the initial energy cost it
      results in increased efficacy of physiological antioxidative systems, which
      reduce oxidative damage and lowers basal metabolic needs. Together with induced
      catabolic enzymes they set a new metabolic equilibrium that saves energy and
      makes it easily available in case of extra needs. While healthy organism profits 
      from improved fitness and mental performance and can withstand higher stress
      without risking a disease, due to the same principle ibogaine provides beneficial
      support at the recovery after diseases including addiction syndrome.

AB  - Only time will tell if serotonergic hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy treatment
      paradigms for SUDs will prove to be safe and effective in double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trials. If they are, they would truly constitute a
      novel psychopharmacologic-psychosocial treatment paradigm to treat addictive
      disorders, although the risk of adverse psychological events would have to be
      controlled through a careful screening process and the risk of misuse of the
      substances or developing use syndromes would have to be considered, although the 
      overall risk would be low because, as mentioned, SHs are unlike all other drugs
      of abuse in that they do not appear to produce dependence syndromes. There
      effects on the NA and DA range from inhibition to slight activation, all this
      without producing addiction. The ability of these medicinal tools to treat a
      range of addictive, psychiatric, and existential disorders is remarkable in scope
      and possibility. They truly represent a potential paradigmatic shift within the
      field of psychiatry, too interesting to not explore further.

TI  - alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the medial habenula modulate the
      mesolimbic dopaminergic response to acute nicotine in vivo.
PG  - 434-40
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.04.015 [doi]
AB  - Habenulo-interpeduncular nicotinic receptors, particularly those containing
      alpha3, beta4 and alpha5 subunits, have recently been implicated in the
      reinforcing effects of nicotine. Our laboratory has shown that injection of
      alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptor antagonists into the medial habenula (MHb)
      decreases self-administration of multiple abused drugs, including nicotine (Glick
      et al., 2006, 2008; 2011). However, it is unclear whether blockade of MHb
      nicotinic receptors has a direct effect on mesolimbic dopamine. Here, we
      performed in vivo microdialysis in female rats. Microdialysis probes were
      implanted into the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptor
      antagonists (18-methoxycoronaridine; 18-MC or alpha-conotoxin AuIB; AuIB), were
      injected into the ipsilateral MHb, just prior to systemic nicotine (0.4 mg/kg,
      s.c.). Dialysate samples were collected before and after drug administration and 
      levels of extracellular dopamine and its metabolites were measured using HPLC.
      Acute nicotine administration increased levels of extracellular dopamine and its 
      metabolites in the NAcc. Pre-treatment with intra-habenular AuIB or 18-MC
      prevented nicotine-induced increases in accumbal dopamine. Neither drug had an
      effect on nicotine-induced increases in dopamine metabolites, suggesting that
      alpha3beta4 receptors do not play a role in dopamine metabolism. The effect of
      intra-habenular blockade of alpha3beta4 receptors on NAcc dopamine was selective 
      for acute nicotine: neither AuIB nor 18-MC prevented increases in NAcc dopamine
      stimulated by acute d-amphetamine or morphine. These results suggest the
      mesolimbic response to acute nicotine, but not to acute administration of other
      drugs of abuse, is directly modulated by alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors in the
      MHb, and emphasize a critical role for habenular nicotinic receptors in
      nicotine's reinforcing effects.

TI  - Phytotherapy of alcoholism.
PG  - 273-80
AB  - Alcoholism is a medical, social, and economic problem where treatment methods
      mostly include difficult and long-lasting psychotherapy and, in some cases, quite
      controversial pharmacological approaches. A number of medicinal plants and pure
      natural compounds are reported to have preventive and therapeutic effects on
      alcoholism and alcohol dependency, but their constituents, efficacy and mechanism
      of action are mostly unknown so far. Recently, kudzu [Pueraria lobata (Willd.)
      Ohwi], St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza
      Bge.), ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Mey.), Japanese raisin tree (Hovenia dulcis
      Thunb.), ibogaine (Tabernanthe iboga H. Bn.), evening primrose (Oenothera biennis
      L.), prickly pear fruit (Opuntia ficus indica (L.) Mill.), purple passionflower
      (Passiflora incarnata L.), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), fenugreek seed (Trigonella
      foenum-graecum L.), ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) and many others drew the 
      attention of researchers. Can, therefore, drugs of natural origin be helpful in
      the treatment of alcoholism or in decreasing alcohol consumption?

AB  - Ibogaine, an alkaloid derived from the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga, has shown
      promising anti-addictive properties in animals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that 
      ibogaine is also anti-addictive in humans. Thus, it alleviates drug craving and
      impedes relapse of drug use. Although not licensed as therapeutic drug, and
      despite evidence that ibogaine may disturb the rhythm of the heart, this alkaloid
      is currently used as an anti-addiction drug in alternative medicine. Here, we
      report that therapeutic concentrations of ibogaine reduce currents through human 
      ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channels. Thereby, we provide a mechanism by
      which ibogaine may generate life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

TI  - The mechanistic basis for noncompetitive ibogaine inhibition of serotonin and
      dopamine transporters.
PG  - 18524-34
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.343681 [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine, a hallucinogenic alkaloid proposed as a treatment for opiate
      withdrawal, has been shown to inhibit serotonin transporter (SERT)
      noncompetitively, in contrast to all other known inhibitors, which are
      competitive with substrate. Ibogaine binding to SERT increases accessibility in
      the permeation pathway connecting the substrate-binding site with the cytoplasm. 
      Because of the structural similarity between ibogaine and serotonin, it had been 
      suggested that ibogaine binds to the substrate site of SERT. The results
      presented here show that ibogaine binds to a distinct site, accessible from the
      cell exterior, to inhibit both serotonin transport and serotonin-induced ionic
      currents. Ibogaine noncompetitively inhibited transport by both SERT and the
      homologous dopamine transporter (DAT). Ibogaine blocked substrate-induced
      currents also in DAT and increased accessibility of the DAT cytoplasmic
      permeation pathway. When present on the cell exterior, ibogaine inhibited SERT
      substrate-induced currents, but not when it was introduced into the cytoplasm
      through the patch electrode. Similar to noncompetitive transport inhibition, the 
      current block was not reversed by increasing substrate concentration. The
      kinetics of inhibitor binding and dissociation, as determined by their effect on 
      SERT currents, indicated that ibogaine does not inhibit by forming a long-lived
      complex with SERT, but rather binds directly to the transporter in an inward-open
      conformation. A kinetic model for transport describing the noncompetitive action 
      of ibogaine and the competitive action of cocaine accounts well for the results
      of the present study.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bacterial infections remain a significant threat 
      to human health. Due to the emergence of widespread antibiotic resistance,
      development of novel antibiotics is required in order to ensure that effective
      treatment remains available. There are several reports on the ethnomedical use of
      Tabernaemontana elegans pertaining to antibacterial activity. AIM OF THE STUDY:
      The aim of this study was to isolate and identify the fraction responsible for
      the antimicrobial activity in Tabernaemontana elegans (Stapf.) root extracts.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active fraction was characterized by thin layer
      chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
      Antibacterial activity was determined using the broth micro-dilution assay and
      antimycobacterial activity using the BACTEC radiometric assay. Cytotoxicity of
      the crude extract and fractions was assessed against primary cell cultures;
      lymphocytes and fibroblasts; as well as a hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) and macrophage 
      (THP-1) cell line using the Neutral Red uptake and MTT assays. RESULTS: The crude
      root extracts were found to contain a high concentration of alkaloids (1.2%,
      w/w). GC-MS analysis identified the indole alkaloids, voacangine and dregamine,
      as major components. Antibacterial activity was limited to the Gram-positive
      bacteria and Mycobacterium species, with MIC values in the range of 64-256mug/ml.
      When combined with antibiotics, additive antibacterial effects were observed.
      Marked cytotoxicity to all cell lines tested was evident in the MTT and Neutral
      Red uptake assays, with IC(50) values <9.81mug/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      confirms the antibacterial activity of Tabernaemontana elegans and supports its
      potential for being investigated further for the development of a novel
      antibacterial compound.

AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive plant alkaloid that is used
      globally in medical and nonmedical settings for opioid detoxification and other
      substance use indications. All available autopsy, toxicological, and
      investigative reports were systematically reviewed for the consecutive series of 
      all known fatalities outside of West Central Africa temporally related to the use
      of ibogaine from 1990 through 2008. Nineteen individuals (15 men, four women
      between 24 and 54 years old) are known to have died within 1.5-76 h of taking
      ibogaine. The clinical and postmortem evidence did not suggest a characteristic
      syndrome of neurotoxicity. Advanced preexisting medical comorbidities, which were
      mainly cardiovascular, and/or one or more commonly abused substances explained or
      contributed to the death in 12 of the 14 cases for which adequate postmortem data
      were available. Other apparent risk factors include seizures associated with
      withdrawal from alcohol and benzodiazepines and the uninformed use of
      ethnopharmacological forms of ibogaine.

LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2011.12.006 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ibogaine is a psychoactive monoterpine indole
      alkaloid extracted from the root bark of Tabernanthe iboga Baill. that is used
      globally in medical and nonmedical settings to treat drug and alcohol addiction, 
      and is of interest as an ethnopharmacological prototype for experimental
      investigation and pharmaceutical development. The question of whether ibogaine
      inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is of pharmacological and toxicological
      significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AChE activity was evaluated utilizing
      reaction with Ellman's reagent with physostigmine as a control. RESULTS: Ibogaine
      inhibited AChE with an IC(50) of 520+/-40 muM. CONCLUSIONS: Ibogaine's inhibition
      of AChE is physiologically negligible, and does not appear to account for
      observations of functional effects in animals and humans that might otherwise
      suggest the possible involvement of pathways linked to muscarinic acetylcholine
      transmission.

AB  - Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, plays a 
      critical role in normal and pathological phenotypes, including solid tumor growth
      and metastasis. Accordingly, the development of new anti-angiogenic agents is
      considered an efficient strategy for the treatment of cancer and other human
      diseases linked with angiogenesis. We have identified voacangine, isolated from
      Voacanga africana, as a novel anti-angiogenic agent. Voacangine inhibits the
      proliferation of HUVECs at an IC(50) of 18 muM with no cytotoxic effects.
      Voacangine significantly suppressed in vitro angiogenesis, such as VEGF-induced
      tube formation and chemoinvasion. Moreover, the compound inhibits in vivo
      angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane at non-toxic doses. In addition,
      voacangine decreased the expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha and
      its target gene, VEGF, in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results 
      suggest that the naturally occurring compound, voacangine, is a novel
      anti-angiogenic compound.

PG  - 236-9

AB  - Advances in computer technology have allowed quantification of the
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and expansion of quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis in
      neurophysiology, as well as clinical neurology, with great success. Among the
      variety of techniques in this field, frequency (spectral) analysis using Fast
      Fourier Transforms (FFT) provides a sensitive tool for time-course studies of
      different compounds acting on particular neurotransmitter systems. Studies
      presented here include Electrocorticogram (ECoG) analysis following exposure to a
      glutamic acid analogue - domoic acid (DOM), psychoactive indole alkaloid -
      ibogaine, as well as cocaine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The ECoG was
      recorded in conscious rats via a tether and swivel system. The EEG signal
      frequency analysis revealed an association between slow-wave EEG activity delta
      and theta and the type of behavioral seizures following DOM administration.
      Analyses of power spectra obtained in rats exposed to cocaine alone or after
      pretreatment with ibogaine indicated the contribution of the serotonergic system 
      in ibogaine mediated response to cocaine (increased power in alpha(1) band).
      Ibogaine also lowered the threshold for cocaine-induced electrographic seizures
      (increased power in the low-frequency bands, delta and theta). Daily
      intraperitoneal administration of cocaine for two weeks was associated with a
      reduction in slow-wave ECoG activity 24 hrs following the last injection when
      compared with controls. Similar decreased cortical activity in low-frequency
      bands observed in chronic cocaine users has been associated with reduced
      metabolic activity in the frontal cortex. The FFT analyses of power spectra
      relative to baseline indicated a significant energy increase over all except
      beta(2) frequency bands following exposure to 400 and 800 mg/kg GHB. The EEG
      alterations detected in rats following exposure to GHB resemble absence seizures 
      observed in human petit mal epilepsy. Spectral analysis of the EEG signals
      combined with behavioral observations may prove to be a useful approach in
      studying chronic exposure to drugs of abuse and treatment of drug dependence.

TI  - Brain regions mediating alpha3beta4 nicotinic antagonist effects of 18-MC on
      nicotine self-administration.
PG  - 71-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.08.001 [doi]
AB  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a putative anti-addictive agent, has been shown
      to decrease the self-administration of several drugs of abuse in rats. 18-MC is a
      potent antagonist at alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors. Consistent with high
      densities of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors being located in the medial habenula
      and the interpeduncular nucleus, 18-MC has been shown to act in these regions to 
      decrease both morphine and methamphetamine self-administration. The present study
      was conducted to determine if 18-MC's effect on nicotine self-administration is
      mediated by acting in these same brain regions. Because moderate densities of
      alpha3beta4 receptors occur in the dorsolateral tegmentum, ventral tegmental
      area, and basolateral amygdala, these brain areas were also examined as potential
      sites of action of 18-MC. Local administration of 18-MC into either the medial
      habenula, the basolateral amygdala or the dorsolateral tegmentum decreased
      nicotine self-administration. Surprisingly, local administration of 18-MC into
      the interpeduncular nucleus increased nicotine self-administration while local
      administration of 18-MC into the ventral tegmental area had no effect on nicotine
      self-administration. Similar effects were produced by local administration of
      either mecamylamine or conotoxin AuIB. These data are consistent with the
      hypothesis that 18-MC decreases nicotine self-administration by indirectly
      modulating the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway via blockade of alpha3beta4
      nicotinic receptors in the medial habenula, basolateral amygdala, and
      dorsolateral tegmentum. The data also suggest that an action of 18-MC in the
      interpeduncular nucleus may attenuate aversive and/or depressive effects of
      nicotine.

LID - 10.1016/j.biocel.2011.05.011 [doi]
AB  - The interaction of ibogaine analogs with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
      (AChRs) in different conformational states was studied by functional and
      structural approaches. The results established that ibogaine analogs: (a) inhibit
      (+/-)-epibatidine-induced Ca(2)(+) influx in human embryonic muscle AChRs with
      the following potency sequence (IC(50) in muM): (+/-)-18-methylaminocoronaridine 
      (5.9+/-0.3) approximately (+/-)-18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC)
      (6.8+/-0.8)>(-)-ibogaine (17+/-3) approximately (+)-catharanthine
      (20+/-1)>(+/-)-albifloranine (46+/-13), (b) bind to the [(3)H]TCP binding site
      with higher affinity when the Torpedo AChR is in the desensitized state compared 
      to that in the resting state. Similar results were obtained using [(3)H]18-MC.
      These and docking results suggest a steric interaction between TCP and ibogaine
      analogs for the same site, (c) enhance [(3)H]cytisine binding to resting but not 
      to desensitized AChRs, with desensitizing potencies (apparent EC(5)(0)) that
      correlate very well with the pK(i) values in the desensitized state, and (d)
      there are good bilinear correlations between the ligand molecular volumes and
      their affinities in the desensitized and resting states, with an optimal volume
      of approximately 345 A(3) for the ibogaine site. These results indicate that the 
      size of the binding sites for ibogaine analogs, located between the serine and
      nonpolar rings and shared with TCP, is an important structural feature for
      binding and for inducing desensitization.

TI  - [Monomeric indole alkaloids from the aerial parts of Catharanthus roseus].
PG  - 471-4
AB  - Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don is a plant of the Catharanthus genus of
      Apocynaceae which has been reported to have therapeutic effects of detoxication
      and anticancer. In order to further study the alkaloid constituents of C. roseus,
      the aerial parts of the plant were extracted with 95% EtOH, and then treated with
      2% H2SO4 and NH3H2O to obtain total alkaloids. The total alkaloids were separated
      and purified by column chromatography over silica gel and prepared by high
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their structures were elucidated on the
      basis of physicochemical properties and spectral data. A new alkaloid together
      with five known compounds were isolated and identified as vindolinine B (1),
      lochnericine (2), horhammericine (3), vindorosine (4), vindoline (5), and
      coronaridine (6). Compound 1 is a new compound and named as vindolinine B.

      18-methoxycoronaridine.
PG  - 308-14
LID - 10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.02.011 [doi]
AB  - Evidence suggests that the development of diet-induced obesity in males and
      females might be mediated by distinct mechanisms, warranting different treatment 
      approaches. In previous studies from this laboratory, a high sucrose diet induced
      excessive weight gain in female but not in male Sprague-Dawley rats, while weight
      gain in both sexes was similarly attenuated by the administration of a selective 
      antagonist of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors, 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC). In
      the present study, assessment of high-fat induced weight gain, consummatory
      behavior and biochemical markers of obesity was conducted in male and female
      Sprague-Dawley rats and the effects of 18-MC treatment were compared in the two
      sexes. Male rats consuming a high-fat (HF) diet developed excessive weight gain
      and fat deposition compared to same same-sex controls fed with a low-fat (LF)
      diet. The development of obesity in these rats was attenuated by repeated
      administration of 18-MC (20mg/kg, i.p.), which significantly reduced their food
      intake without altering water intake. In contrast, female rats consuming a HF
      diet did not become obese and did not respond to 18-MC treatment. These results
      show that males and females are differentially responsive to HF-induced obesity; 
      the 18-MC data suggest that alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors may participate in
      maintaining obesity, possibly becoming a new and important target for
      anti-obesity agents.

TI  - Effects of 18-methoxycoronaridine on ghrelin-induced increases in sucrose intake 
      and accumbal dopamine overflow in female rats.
PG  - 247-56
LID - 10.1007/s00213-010-2132-0 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a selective antagonist of alpha3beta4 
      nicotinic receptors, has been previously shown, in rats, to reduce the
      self-administration of several drugs of abuse, reduce operant responding for
      sucrose, and prevent the development of sucrose-induced obesity. It has become
      increasingly apparent that there is a significant overlap between the systems
      regulating drug reward and food intake, therefore, we investigated whether 18-MC 
      might modulate the effects of ghrelin, one of several orexigenic peptides
      recently implicated in both feeding and drug reward. OBJECTIVES: In female
      Sprague-Dawley rats, we determined whether acute 18-MC treatment would reduce
      both ghrelin-induced increases in sucrose intake and ghrelin-elicited increases
      in accumbal dopamine levels. RESULTS: Pretreatment with 18-MC (20 mg/kg, i.p.),
      given prior to the administration of ghrelin (1 mug, lateral ventricle), blocked 
      ghrelin-induced increases in sucrose (5%) intake in a two-bottle open access
      paradigm. Using in vivo microdialysis, 18-MC (both 20 and 40 mg/kg) prevented
      ghrelin (2 mug, intraventral tegmental area)-induced increases in extracellular
      dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. 18-MC had no effect on deposition of fat or on
      serum levels of glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol in ghrelin-treated rats. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that one potential mechanism by which
      18-MC exerts its effects on palatable food consumption is via modulation of
      ghrelin's effects.

TI  - Noribogaine, but not 18-MC, exhibits similar actions as ibogaine on GDNF
      expression and ethanol self-administration.
PG  - 424-33
LID - 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2010.00251.x [doi]
AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring alkaloid that has been reported to decrease
      various adverse phenotypes associated with exposure to drugs of abuse and alcohol
      in human and rodent models. Unfortunately, ibogaine cannot be used as a
      medication to treat addiction because of severe side effects. Previously, we
      reported that the desirable actions of ibogaine to reduce self-administration of,
      and relapse to, alcohol consumption are mediated via the upregulation of the
      expression of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the
      midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the consequent activation of the GDNF 
      pathway. The ibogaine metabolite, noribogaine, and a synthetic derivative of
      ibogaine, 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), possess a similar anti-addictive
      profile as ibogaine in rodent models, but without some of its adverse side
      effects. Here, we determined whether noribogaine and/or 18-MC, like ibogaine,
      increase GDNF expression, and whether their site of action to reduce alcohol
      consumption is the VTA. We used SH-SY5Y cells as a cell culture model and found
      that noribogaine, like ibogaine, but not 18-MC, induces a robust increase in GDNF
      mRNA levels. Next, we tested the effect of intra-VTA infusion of noribogaine and 
      18-MC on rat operant alcohol self-administration and found that noribogaine, but 
      not 18-MC, in the VTA decreases responding for alcohol. Together, our results
      suggest that noribogaine and 18-MC have different mechanisms and sites of action.

      repeated administration of 18-MC on body weight gain, deposition of fat,
      consummatory behavior and biochemical markers of obesity in male rats were also
      assessed. In contrast to females, males consuming ad libitum quantities of
      sucrose solution (30%) in combination with normal chow did not become obese; they
      did not gain excessive weight nor show excessive fat deposition. Repeated
      administration of 18-MC (20mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated weight gain in both
      sucrose-consuming and control animals without altering food or fluid intake. The 
      present results indicate that males and females are differentially responsive to 
      high carbohydrate-diet obesity. Such gender disparities could be secondary to
      sex-specific alterations in cholinergic mechanisms of feeding and body weight
      regulation.

TI  - Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal SEC24 binding motif of the serotonin
      transporter impair folding of the transporter.
PG  - 39201-10
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.118000 [doi]
AB  - The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a member of the SLC6 family of solute
      carriers. SERT plays a crucial role in synaptic neurotransmission by retrieving
      released serotonin. The intracellular carboxyl terminus of various
      neurotransmitter transporters has been shown to be important for the correct
      delivery of SLC6 family members to the cell surface. Here we studied the
      importance of the C terminus in trafficking and folding of human SERT. Serial
      truncations followed by mutagenesis identified sequence spots (PG(601,602),
      RII(607-609)) within the C terminus relevant for export of SERT from the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RI(607,608) is homologous to the RL-motif that in
      other SLC6 family members provides a docking site for the COPII component Sec24D.
      The primary defect resulting from mutation at PG(601,602) and RI(607,608) was
      impaired folding, because mutated transporters failed to bind the inhibitor
      [(3)H]imipramine. In contrast, when retained in the ER (e.g. by dominant negative
      Sar1) the wild type transporter bound [(3)H]imipramine with an affinity
      comparable to that of the surface-expressed transporter. SERT-RI(607,608)AA and
      SERT-RII(607-609)AAA were partially rescued by treatment of cells with the
      nonspecific chemical chaperone DMSO or the specific pharmacochaperone ibogaine
      (which binds to the inward facing conformation of SERT) but not by other classes 
      of ligands (inhibitors, substrates, amphetamines). These observations (i)
      demonstrate an hitherto unappreciated role of the C terminus in the folding of
      SERT, (ii) indicates that the folding trajectory proceeds via an inward facing
      intermediate, and (iii) suggest a model where the RI-motif plays a crucial role
      in preventing premature Sec24-recruitment and export of incorrectly folded
      transporters.

TI  - The high-affinity binding site for tricyclic antidepressants resides in the outer
      vestibule of the serotonin transporter.
PG  - 1026-35
LID - 10.1124/mol.110.067538 [doi]
AB  - The structure of the bacterial leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus
      (LeuT(Aa)) has been used as a model for mammalian Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent
      transporters, in particular the serotonin transporter (SERT). The crystal
      structure of LeuT(Aa) liganded to tricyclic antidepressants predicts simultaneous
      binding of inhibitor and substrate. This is incompatible with the mutually
      competitive inhibition of substrates and inhibitors of SERT. We explored the
      binding modes of tricyclic antidepressants by homology modeling and docking
      studies. Two approaches were used subsequently to differentiate between three
      clusters of potential docking poses: 1) a diagnostic SERT(Y95F) mutation, which
      greatly reduced the affinity for [(3)H]imipramine but did not affect substrate
      binding; 2) competition binding experiments in the presence and absence of
      carbamazepine (i.e., a tricyclic imipramine analog with a short side chain that
      competes with [(3)H]imipramine binding to SERT). Binding of releasers
      (para-chloroamphetamine, methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine/ecstasy) and of
      carbamazepine were mutually exclusive, but Dixon plots generated in the presence 
      of carbamazepine yielded intersecting lines for serotonin, MPP(+), paroxetine,
      and ibogaine. These observations are consistent with a model, in which 1) the
      tricyclic ring is docked into the outer vestibule and the dimethyl-aminopropyl
      side chain points to the substrate binding site; 2) binding of amphetamines
      creates a structural change in the inner and outer vestibule that precludes
      docking of the tricyclic ring; 3) simultaneous binding of ibogaine (which binds
      to the inward-facing conformation) and of carbamazepine is indicative of a second
      binding site in the inner vestibule, consistent with the pseudosymmetric fold of 
      monoamine transporters. This may be the second low-affinity binding site for
      antidepressants.

      opropanecarboxylate [1, (+/-)-PPCC], a selective sigma ligand, were synthesized. 
      The (+)- and (-)-enantiomers bind predominantly to sigma(1) receptors and have a 
      reduced sigma(2) affinity. Both individually restore the astroglial oxidative
      status modified by glutamate, counteracting also transglutaminase-2
      overexpression. They exhibited in vivo anti-opioid effects on kappa opioid (KOP) 
      receptor-mediated analgesia. Our findings demonstrate that the enantiomers
      display mainly sigma(1) agonist activity and that they have neuroprotective
      effects.

PG  - 1525-35
AB  - The interaction of ibogaine and phencyclidine (PCP) with human (h)
      alpha3beta4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in different conformational
      states was determined by functional and structural approaches including,
      radioligand binding assays, Ca2+ influx detections, and thermodynamic and
      kinetics measurements. The results established that (a) ibogaine inhibits
      (+/-)-epibatidine-induced Ca2+ influx in h(alpha)3beta4 AChRs with approximately 
      9-fold higher potency than that for PCP, (b) [3H]ibogaine binds to a single site 
      in the h(alpha)3beta4 AChR ion channel with relatively high affinity (Kd = 0.46
      +/- 0.06 microM), and ibogaine inhibits [3H]ibogaine binding to the desensitized 
      h(alpha)3beta4 AChR with slightly higher affinity compared to the resting AChR.
      This is explained by a slower dissociation rate from the desensitized ion channel
      compared to the resting ion channel, and (c) PCP inhibits [3H]ibogaine binding to
      the h(alpha)3beta4 AChR, suggesting overlapping sites. The experimental results
      correlate with the docking simulations suggesting that ibogaine and PCP interact 
      with a binding domain located between the serine (position 6') and
      valine/phenylalanine (position 13') rings. This interaction is mediated mainly by
      van der Waals contacts, which is in agreement with the observed enthalpic
      contribution determined by non-linear chromatography. However, the calculated
      entropic contribution also indicates local conformational changes. Collectively
      our data suggest that ibogaine and PCP bind to overlapping sites located between 
      the serine and valine/phenylalanine rings, to finally block the AChR ion channel,
      and in the case of ibogaine, to probably maintain the AChR in the desensitized
      state for longer time.

AB  - We compared the interaction of several catharanthine alkaloids including,
      ibogaine, vincristine, and vinblastine, with that for the noncompetitive
      antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) at muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
      (AChRs) in different conformational states. The results established that
      catharanthine alkaloids: (a) inhibit, in a noncompetitive manner,
      (+/-)-epibatidine-induced Ca(2+) influx in TE671-halpha1beta1gammadelta cells
      with similar potencies (IC(50)=17-25microM), (b) inhibit [(3)H]TCP binding to the

      (c) enhance [(3)H]cytisine binding to resting but activatable Torpedo AChRs,
      suggesting desensitizing properties. Interestingly, PCP inhibits [(3)H]ibogaine
      binding to the AChR in a steric fashion. This is corroborated by additional
      docking experiments indicating that the amino groups of neutral ibogaine form
      hydrogen bonds with the serine ring (position 6'), a location shared with PCP.
      Since protonated ibogaine forms a salt bridge with one of the acidic residues at 
      the outer ring (position 20'), this ligand could be first attracted to the
      entrance of the channel by electrostatic interactions. Our data indicate that the
      catharanthine moiety is a minimum structural requirement for AChR inhibition
      including, ion channel blocking and desensitization, and that ibogaine and PCP
      bind to overlapping sites in the desensitized AChR ion channel.

AB  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a selective antagonist of alpha3beta4 nicotinic
      receptors, has been shown to reduce the self-administration of several drugs of
      abuse. Recently, this agent has also been shown to attenuate sucrose reward,
      decrease sucrose intake and prevent the development of sucrose-induced obesity in
      rats. The present experiments were designed to determine whether the latter
      effect was due to an 18-MC-induced conditioned taste aversion to sucrose. Both
      18-MC (20mg/ kg, i.p.) and control agent, lithium chloride (100mg/kg, i.p.),
      reduced sucrose intake 24h after association with sucrose; however, only lithium 
      chloride reduced sucrose intake 72h later. Consistent with previous data, 18-MC
      appears to have proactive effect for 24h and it does not induce a conditioned
      taste aversion.

TI  - Interaction of 18-methoxycoronaridine with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in
      different conformational states.

LID - 10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.03.013 [doi]
AB  - The interaction of 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) with nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptors (AChRs) was compared with that for ibogaine and phencyclidine (PCP).
      The results established that 18-MC: (a) is more potent than ibogaine and PCP
      inhibiting (+/-)-epibatidine-induced AChR Ca(2+) influx. The potency of 18-MC is 
      increased after longer pre-incubation periods, which is in agreement with the
      enhancement of [(3)H]cytisine binding to resting but activatable Torpedo AChRs,
      (b) binds to a single site in the Torpedo AChR with high affinity and inhibits
      [(3)H]TCP binding to desensitized AChRs in a steric fashion, suggesting the
      existence of overlapping sites. This is supported by our docking results
      indicating that 18-MC interacts with a domain located between the serine
      (position 6') and valine (position 13') rings, and (c) inhibits [(3)H]TCP,
      [(3)H]ibogaine, and [(3)H]18-MC binding to desensitized AChRs with higher
      affinity compared to resting AChRs. This can be partially attributed to a slower 
      dissociation rate from the desensitized AChR compared to that from the resting
      AChR. The enthalpic contribution is more important than the entropic contribution
      when 18-MC binds to the desensitized AChR compared to that for the resting AChR, 
      and vice versa. Ibogaine analogs inhibit the AChR by interacting with a luminal
      domain that is shared with PCP, and by inducing desensitization.

AB  - Drug interaction with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein 
      (BCRP) may influence its tissue disposition including blood-brain barrier
      transport and result in potent drug-drug interactions. The limited data obtained 
      using in-vitro models indicate that methadone, buprenorphine, and cannabinoids
      may interact with human P-gp; but almost nothing is known about drugs of abuse
      and BCRP. We used in vitro P-gp and BCRP inhibition flow cytometric assays with
      hMDR1- and hBCRP-transfected HEK293 cells to test 14 compounds or metabolites
      frequently involved in addiction, including buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine,
      methadone, ibogaine, cocaine, cocaethylene, amphetamine,
      N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, nicotine, 
      ketamine, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), naloxone, and morphine. Drugs that
      in vitro inhibited P-gp or BCRP were tested in hMDR1- and hBCRP-MDCKII
      bidirectional transport studies. Human P-gp was significantly inhibited in a
      concentration-dependent manner by
      norbuprenorphine>buprenorphine>methadone>ibogaine and THC. Similarly, BCRP was
      inhibited by buprenorphine>norbuprenorphine>ibogaine and THC. None of the other
      tested compounds inhibited either transporter, even at high concentration (100
      microm). Norbuprenorphine (transport efflux ratio approoximately 11) and
      methadone (transport efflux ratio approoximately 1.9) transport was
      P-gp-mediated; however, with no significant stereo-selectivity regarding
      methadone enantiomers. BCRP did not transport any of the tested compounds.
      However, the clinical significance of the interaction of norbuprenorphine with
      P-gp remains to be evaluated.

AB  - Ibogaine has been extensively studied in the last decades in relation to its
      anti-addictive properties that have been repeatedly reported as being addiction
      interruptive and craving eliminative. In our previous study we have already
      demonstrated induction of energy related enzymes in rat brains treated with
      ibogaine at a dose of 20mg/kg i.p. 24 and 72 h prior to proteomic analysis. In
      this study a model organism yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cultivated with
      ibogaine in a concentration of 1mg/l. Energy metabolism cluster enzymes
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase and
      alcohol dehydrogenase were induced after 5h of exposure. This is a compensation
      of demonstrated ATP pool decrease after ibogaine. Yeast in a stationary growth
      phase is an accepted model for studies of housekeeping metabolism of eukaryotes, 
      including humans. Study showed that ibogaine's influence on metabolism is neither
      species nor tissue specific. Effect is not mediated by binding of ibogaine to
      receptors, as previously described in literature since they are lacking in this
      model.

TI  - [Chemical and DNA analyses for the products of a psychoactive plant, Voacanga
      africana].
PG  - 975-82
AB  - Voacanga africana (Apocynaceae) is a small tropical African tree. The root bark
      and seeds of this tree contain a number of alkaloids, including ibogaine (a
      hallucinogenic/aphrodisiac compound in bark), tabersonine (a major constituteent 
      of seeds) and other voacanga alkaloids, traditionally used in Africa for
      religious purposes. Recently, some kinds of products containing this plant (root 
      bark and seeds) have been distributed in the drug market in expectation of its
      hallucinogenic/aphrodisiac effects. There has been no report that has discussed
      quantitative analyses of these alkaloids in the products and their botanical
      origins. In this study, to investigate the trend of such a non-controlled
      psychotropic plant of abuse, a simultaneous analytical method was developed using
      LC/MS for the voacanga alkaloids including ibogaine and tabersonine in the
      commercial products of V. africana. Moreover, the botanical origins of these
      products were investigated by DNA analyses. As a result of the LC/MS analyses,
      the products were classified into two chemical types; an ibogaine-type and a
      tabersonine-type. The samples of the ibogaine-type contain ibogaine (0.05-0.6%)
      and other voacanga alkaloids; voacamine, voacamidine and voacangine, while those 
      of the tabersonine-type mainly contain tabersonine (0.6-1.6%). The sequence
      analyses of chloroplast DNA, trnL-F region suggested that most of the products
      were derived from V. africana or closely related plants. They were classified
      into four genotypes based on nucleotide sequence of the trnL-F IGS region. The
      proposed methods of chemical and DNA analyses would be useful for investigating
      the trend in the distribution of the products of V. africana.

AB  - Serotonin transporter (SERT) is the main target for widely used antidepressant
      agents. Several of these drugs, including imipramine, citalopram, sertraline, and
      fluoxetine (Prozac), bound more avidly to SERT in the presence of Cl(-). In
      contrast, Cl(-) did not enhance cocaine or paroxetine binding. A Cl(-) binding
      site recently identified in SERT, and shown to be important for Cl(-) dependent
      transport, was also critical for the Cl(-) dependence of antidepressant affinity.
      Mutation of the residues contributing to this site eliminated the Cl(-)-mediated 
      affinity increase for imipramine and fluoxetine. Analysis of ligand docking to a 
      single state of SERT indicated only small differences in the energy of
      interaction between bound ligands and Cl(-). These differences in interaction
      energy cannot account for the affinity differences observed for Cl(-) dependence.
      However, fluoxetine binding led to a conformational change, detected by cysteine 
      accessibility experiments, that was qualitatively different from that induced by 
      cocaine or other ligands. Given the known Cl(-) requirement for serotonin-induced
      conformational changes, we propose that Cl(-) binding facilitates conformational 
      changes required for optimal binding of fluoxetine and other antidepressant
      drugs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Problems associated with the increasing abuse of plant-derived
      psychoactive substances have recently attracted attention. This study involved
      bioanalytical and clinical examinations of intoxication cases suspected to be
      linked to such plant materials. METHODS: Urine samples were collected at
      emergency wards in Sweden from patients who either admitted or were suspected of 
      ingestion of psychoactive plant materials. The bioanalytical investigation
      employed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry multicomponent method
      covering 10 plant-derived substances (atropine, dimethyltryptamine, ephedrine,
      harmaline, harmine, ibogaine, lysergic acid amide, psilocin, scopolamine, and
      yohimbine) and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for asarone. Routine
      testing for illicit drugs was also performed. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period, 103 
      urine samples collected from mainly young people (age range 13-52 years, median
      19) were studied. Among 53 cases where ingestion of any of the 11 plant-derived
      substances covered in this study was admitted or suspected, 41 (77%) could be
      confirmed bioanalytically. Nine of the 11 substances tested for were detected,
      the exceptions being ibogaine and yohimbine. Psilocin, originating from ingestion
      of hallucinogenic mushrooms, was the most frequent drug accounting for 54% of the
      cases. The most common means of drug acquisition (56%) was purchase over the
      Internet. CONCLUSION: The patients using psychoactive plant materials were mainly
      young and commonly used the Internet for drug acquisition. Having access to
      bioanalytical methods for detection of plant-derived psychoactives is therefore
      considered important, when providing clinical toxicology service.

TI  - Ibogaine labeling with 99mTc-tricarbonyl: synthesis and transport at the mouse
      blood-brain barrier.
PG  - 4650-60
LID - 10.1002/jps.21771 [doi]
AB  - The (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl core may be used as an ideal tool for gamma-labeling
      ligands in noninvasive SPECT imaging. However, most (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl-labeled
      agents have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We radiolabeled
      the neuroactive indole ibogaine with (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl and measured its
      transport into the mouse brain by in situ brain perfusion. We measured the
      interactions of [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)-ibogaine](+) and (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl with the
      main BBB efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP in vitro and in vivo. Ibogaine was
      radiolabeled (yield: over 95%). [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)-ibogaine](+) entered the brain
      (K(in)) poorly (0.18 microL/g/s), at about the same rate as (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl
      (0.16 microL/g/s) and [(99m)Tc-sestamibi](+) (0.10 microL/g/s). The CNS tracer
      [(99m)Tc-HMPAO](0) entered the brain approximately 70-times higher than
      [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)-ibogaine](+). In vitro studies revealed that neither
      [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)-ibogaine](+) nor (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl ion were substrates for P-gp
      or BCRP. But lowering the membrane dipole potential barrier with phloretin
      enhanced the brain transport of [(99m)Tc(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+) approximately
      3-fold. Thus, ibogaine directly labeled with (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl is not suitable 
      for CNS imaging because of its poor uptake. Brain transport is not restricted by 
      efflux transporters but is reduced by its lipophilicity and interaction with the 
      membrane-positive dipole potential.

LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.04.019 [doi]
AB  - The iboga alkaloid congener, 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), decreases
      self-administration of multiple drugs of abuse. Here, in a biased procedure, we
      investigated whether 18-MC would have a similar effect on the acquisition,
      expression and reinstatement of a cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) in
      male Sprague-Dawley rats. While 18-MC attenuated acquisition of a cocaine CPP, it
      had no effect on CPP expression, and enhanced the reinstatement of cocaine CPP
      following extinction. Our results are consistent with those obtained using
      ibogaine, but reinforce the notion that acquisition, expression and reinstatement
      of a CPP likely involve separate mechanisms.

AB  - A sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous detection of 10
      plant-derived psychoactive substances (atropine, N,N-dimethyltryptamine,
      ephedrine, harmaline, harmine, ibogaine, lysergic acid amide, psilocin,
      scopolamine and yohimbine) in urine was developed. Direct injection of urine
      diluted with 3 deuterated internal standards allowed for a readily accessible
      method suitable for application in clinical intoxication cases. Separation was
      achieved using reversed phase chromatography and gradient elution with a total
      analysis time of 14 min. Electrospray ionization was used and ions were monitored
      in the positive selected reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curves were
      linear (r(2)>0.999) and the total imprecision at high (1000 microg/L) and low (50
      microg/L) substance concentrations were 4.9-13.8% and 8.3-26%, respectively.
      Infusing the analytes post column and injecting matrix samples showed limited
      influence by ion suppression. The multi-component method proved to be useful for 
      investigation of authentic cases of intoxication with plant-derived psychoactive 
      drugs and was indicated to cover the clinically relevant concentration ranges.

AB  - Many plants contain toxic alkaloids which may be dangerous to humans. Despite the
      large number of poisonous plants, cases of fatal plant poisonings are relatively 
      rare. The frequencies of poisonings and the plants involved are often regionally 
      specific. Plant poisonings can be aggregated into three categories: unintended
      ingestions, intended ingestions, and poisoning due to abuse of plant material.
      Unintended ingestions often occur in children or from a mix-up of plants and
      mushrooms in adults. Intended ingestions are common in homicides and suicides.
      Increasingly common is the abuse of plants for hallucinogenic reasons.
      Toxicological analysis of such alkaloids may help in diagnosis of poisoning or
      abuse cases. This review describes the toxic alkaloids aconitine, atropine,
      coniine, colchicine, cytisine, dimethyltryptamine, harmine, harmaline, ibogaine, 
      kawain, mescaline, scopolamine, and taxine, which are often involved in fatal and
      non-fatal poisonings. The paper summarizes the symptoms of the intoxications and 
      reviews the methods of detection of their toxic constituents in biological
      fluids.

TI  - Acute toxicity of ibogaine and noribogaine.
PG  - 984-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate acute toxic effect of ibogaine and noribogaine on the
      survival of mice and determine median lethal doses of the substances mentioned.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: White laboratory mice were used for the experiments.
      Ibogaine and noribogaine were administered intragastrically to mice via a stomach
      tube. Control animals received the same volume of saline. The median lethal dose 
      was calculated with the help of a standard formula. RESULTS: To determine the
      median lethal dose of ibogaine, the doses of 100, 300, 400, and 500 mg/kg were
      administered intragastrically to mice. The survival time of mice after the drug
      administration was recorded, as well as the number of survived mice in each
      group. Upon administration of ibogaine at a dose of 500 mg/kg, all mice in this
      dose group died. Three out of four mice died in the group, which received 300
      mg/kg of ibogaine. No mouse deaths were observed in the group, which received 100
      mg/kg of ibogaine. The determined LD(50) value of ibogaine equals to 263 mg/kg of
      body mass. In order to determine the median lethal dose of noribogaine, the doses
      of 300, 500, 700, and 900 mg/kg were administered to mice intragastrically.
      Noribogaine given at a dose of 500 mg/kg had no impact on the mouse survival. The
      increase of noribogaine dose to 700 mg/kg of mouse body mass led to the death of 
      three out of four mice in the group. Upon administration of noribogaine at a dose
      of 900 mg/kg, all mice in this group died. The LD(50) value of noribogaine in
      mice determined on the basis of the number of dead mice and the size of the doses
      used equals to 630 mg/kg of mouse body mass. The behavior of mice was observed
      upon administration of ibogaine or noribogaine. Low doses of ibogaine and
      noribogaine had no impact on the mouse behavior. External effects (convulsions,
      nervous behaviour, limb paralysis) were observed only when substances were
      administrated at higher doses. CONCLUSIONS: It has been determined that the
      median lethal dose of ibogaine and noribogaine equals to 263 mg and 630 mg/kg of 
      mouse body mass, respectively. The toxicity of ibogaine is 2.4 times higher than 
      that of noribogaine.

TI  - Brain regions mediating alpha3beta4 nicotinic antagonist effects of 18-MC on
      methamphetamine and sucrose self-administration.
PG  - 91-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.09.038 [doi]
AB  - The novel iboga alkaloid congener 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) is a putative
      anti-addictive agent that has been shown, in rats, to decrease the
      self-administration of several drugs of abuse. Previous work has established that
      18-MC is a potent antagonist at alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors. Because high
      densities of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors occur in the medial habenula and the
      interpeduncular nucleus and moderate densities occur in the dorsolateral
      tegmentum, ventral tegmental area, and basolateral amygdala, the present study
      was conducted to determine if 18-MC could act in these brain areas to modulate
      methamphetamine self-administration in rats. Local administration of 18-MC into
      either the medial habenula, the interpeduncular area or the basolateral amygdala 
      decreased methamphetamine self-administration. Similar results were produced by
      local administration into the same brain areas of two other alpha3beta4 nicotinic
      antagonists, mecamylamine and alpha-conotoxin AuIB. Local administration of
      18-MC, or the other antagonists, into the dorsolateral tegmentum or the ventral
      tegmental area had no effect on methamphetamine self-administration. In contrast,
      local administration of 18-MC and the other antagonists decreased sucrose
      self-administration when administered into the dorsolateral tegmentum or
      basolateral amygdala but had no effect when infused into the medial habenula,
      interpeduncular nucleus, or ventral tegmental area. These data are consistent
      with the hypothesis that 18-MC decreases methamphetamine self-administration by
      indirectly modulating the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway via blockade of
      alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway and the
      basolateral amygdala. The data also suggest that the basolateral amygdala along
      with a different pathway involving alpha3beta4 receptors in the dorsolateral
      tegmentum mediate the effect of 18-MC on sucrose self-administration.

TI  - The plant alkaloid voacamine induces apoptosis-independent autophagic cell death 
      on both sensitive and multidrug resistant human osteosarcoma cells.
PG  - 1020-33
AB  - In our previous studies, the bisindolic alkaloid voacamine (VOA), isolated from
      the plant Peschiera fuchsiaefolia, proved to exert a chemosensitizing effect on
      cultured multidrug resistant (MDR) osteosarcoma cells exposed to doxorubicin
      (DOX). In particular, VOA was capable of inhibiting P-glycoprotein action in a
      competitive way, thus explaining the enhancement of the cytotoxic effect induced 
      by DOX on MDR cells. Afterwards, preliminary observations suggested that such an 
      enhancement did not involve the apoptotic process but was due instead to the
      induction of autophagic cell death. The results of the present investigation
      demonstrate that the plant alkaloid VOA is an autophagy inducer able to exert
      apoptosis-independent cytotoxic effect on both wild-type and MDR tumor cells. In 
      fact, under treatment condition causing about 50 percent of cell death, no
      evidence of apoptosis could be revealed by microscopical observations, Annexin
      V-FITC labeling and analysis of PARP cleavage, whereas the same cells underwent
      apoptosis when treated with apoptosis inducers, such as doxorubicin and
      staurosporine. Conversely, VOA-induced autophagy was clearly evidentiated by
      electron microscopy observations, monodansylcadaverine staining, LC3 expression, 
      and conversion. These results were confirmed by the analysis of the modulating
      effects of the pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors prior to VOA
      administration. In addition, transfection of osteosarcoma cells with siRNA
      against ATG genes reduced VOA cytotoxicity. In conclusion, considering the very
      debated dual role of autophagy in cancer cells (protective or lethal, pro- or
      anti- apoptotic) our findings seem to demonstrate, at least in vitro, that a
      natural product able to induce autophagy can be effective against drug resistant 
      tumors, either used alone or in association with conventional chemotherapeutics.

TI  - 18-methoxycoronaridine: a potential new treatment for obesity in rats?
PG  - 339-50
LID - 10.1007/s00213-008-1290-9 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Excessive eating often leads to obesity. Although a variety of
      neurotransmitters and brain regions are involved in modulating food intake, a
      role of accumbal dopamine is thought to be critical for several aspects of this
      behavior. Since 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a selective antagonist of
      alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors, was previously shown to alter dopamine release
      in the nucleus accumbens in response to chronic injections of cocaine and
      morphine, this drug could be a promising therapy for abnormal eating behavior.
      OBJECTIVES: Assess the effect of 18-MC on the consumption of sucrose (15%) vs.
      water in a self-administration paradigm and on the intake of freely available
      palatable fluids (i.e., 5% sucrose, 0.1% saccharin, and 0.6% saline solutions) as
      well as on water intake. Determine whether repeated administration of 18-MC (20
      mg/kg i.p.) affects weight gain, food intake, and fat deposition in rats drinking
      30% sucrose solution. RESULTS: Acute administration of 18-MC (10-40 mg/kg i.p.)
      reduced operant responding for sucrose and decreased ad libitum ingestion of
      sucrose, saccharin, and saline. The highest dose of 18-MC also reduced
      consumption of water when palatable fluids were not available. In rats having
      unlimited access to sucrose (30%), chronic treatment with 18-MC (20 mg/kg i.p.)
      prevented sucrose-induced increases in body weight, decreased fat deposition, and
      reduced consumption of sucrose while not altering food intake. CONCLUSIONS: These
      data suggest that antagonism of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors may be involved
      in the regulation of intake of palatable substances regardless of its caloric
      value and may participate in maintaining obesity.

TI  - Ibogaine, an anti-addictive drug: pharmacology and time to go further in
      development. A narrative review.

AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid derived from the bark of the root of the African
      shrub Tabernanthe iboga. Psychoactive properties of ibogaine have been known for 
      decades. More recently, based on experimental data from animals and anectodal
      reports in human, it has been found that this drug has anti-addictive effects.
      Several patents were published between 1969 and 1995. The pharmacology of
      ibogaine is quite complex, affecting many different neurotransmitter systems
      simultaneously. However, the pharmacological targets underlying the physiological
      and psychological actions of ibogaine are not completely understood. Ibogaine is 
      rapidly metabolized in the body in noribogaine. The purpose of this article was
      to review data from the literature concerning physicochemical properties,
      bio-analytical methods, and pharmacology of ibogaine; this article will be
      focused on the use of this drug as anti-addictive agent.

AB  - A new screening method for the simultaneous determination of thirteen plant
      alkaloids (aconitine, anabasine, atropine, brucine, colchicine, cotinine,
      cytisine, harmine, ibogaine, nicotine, scopolamine, strychnine, yohimbine) in a
      human specimen was developed based on solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase
      liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. The validated method
      enables selective identification as well as accurate and sensitive
      quantification. The analysis of forensic and clinical samples emphasizes the
      applicability for intoxications and drug abuse, as well as for compliance
      control.

TI  - GDNF is a fast-acting potent inhibitor of alcohol consumption and relapse.
PG  - 8114-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0711755105 [doi]
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that the action of the natural alkaloid, ibogaine, to
      reduce alcohol (ethanol) consumption is mediated by the glial cell line-derived
      neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here we set out
      to test the actions of GDNF in the VTA on ethanol-drinking behaviors. We found
      that GDNF infusion very rapidly and dose-dependently reduced rat ethanol, but not
      sucrose, operant self-administration. A GDNF-mediated decrease in ethanol
      consumption was also observed in rats with a history of high voluntary ethanol
      intake. We found that the action of GDNF on ethanol consumption was specific to
      the VTA as infusion of the growth factor into the neighboring substantia nigra
      did not affect operant responses for ethanol. We further show that intra-VTA GDNF
      administration rapidly activated the MAPK signaling pathway in the VTA and that
      inhibition of the MAPK pathway in the VTA blocked the reduction of ethanol
      self-administration by GDNF. Importantly, we demonstrate that GDNF infused into
      the VTA alters rats' responses in a model of relapse. Specifically, GDNF
      application blocked reacquisition of ethanol self-administration after
      extinction. Together, these results suggest that GDNF, via activation of the MAPK
      pathway, is a fast-acting selective agent to reduce the motivation to consume and
      seek alcohol.

AB  - Extracellular enzymes secreted by Candida albicans are claimed to be virulence
      factors responsible for penetration of the yeast into host cells. Substances able
      to inhibit lipolytic and proteinase activities of the fungus might be of
      therapeutic use in some pathologic conditions caused by C. albicans. In the
      present work, we have tested the influence of the flavonoid compounds apigenin
      and kaempferol, the indole alkaloid ibogaine, and the protoberberine alkaloid
      berberine on the in vitro enzyme activity of C. albicans. The substances showed
      complex suppressive effects concerning the processes of adherence to epithelial
      cells, secreted aspartyl proteinase activity, and the rate of cell wall protein
      glycosylation. Apigenin and kaempferol were administered in systemic C. albicans 
      infection, demonstrating an increased number of survivors by kaempferol. The
      application of apigenin, kaempferol, ibogaine, and berberine in cutaneous
      infection suppressed the symptoms and accelerated elimination of the yeast from
      the site of inoculation.

TI  - The near-death experience: a cerebellar method to protect body and soul-lessons
      from the Iboga healing ceremony in Gabon.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - The root bark of the Iboga shrub (Tabernanthe iboga) is used in Gabon, Africa, to
      induce a near-death experience for spiritual and psychological purposes. The
      pharmacology of ibogaine, a psychoactive indole alkaloid extracted from the bark,
      has been investigated extensively because of its putative qualities to treat
      addiction. This review of these studies and neuroscientific approaches to the
      near-death experience compared with field studies of traditional African rituals 
      has generated new insights into the neurological correlates and the psychological
      effects and after-effects of the near-death experience. Ibogaine stimulates the
      cerebellar fastigial nucleus in the same manner as ischemia and leads to a
      medium-term protection of the brain against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. At
      the same time, it induces changes in the autonomic nervous and the cardiovascular
      systems, which aid in the survival of ischemia: iboga intake and ischemia both
      lead to slowing of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity (dominance of theta and
      delta waves), a stimulation of the limbic system, and a dominance of a
      phylogenetically older branch of the vagus nerve, originating in the dorsal motor
      nucleus, which lowers the metabolic rate of the body. In conclusion, the
      near-death experience seems to be the result of a dominance of phylogenetically
      and ontogenetically old neurological structures and brain waves, which are
      allowed to show their (para)psychological abilities in the absence of cortical
      dominance. If parts of the neocortex are still active and permit observation and 
      memory performance, the experience can be integrated within the personality. The 
      newly learned peaceful state ofvagal and subcortical dominance can be actively
      self-induced. Implications of this model for alternative healing are discussed.

TI  - The ibogaine medical subculture.
PG  - 9-24
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive indole alkaloid 
      that is used to treat substance-related disorders in a global medical subculture,
      and is of interest as an ethnopharmacological prototype for experimental
      investigation and possible rational pharmaceutical development. The subculture is
      also significant for risks due to the lack of clinical and pharmaceutical
      standards. This study describes the ibogaine medical subculture and presents
      quantitative data regarding treatment and the purpose for which individuals have 
      taken ibogaine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All identified ibogaine "scenes" (defined 
      as a provider in an associated setting) apart from the Bwiti religion in Africa
      were studied with intensive interviewing, review of the grey literature including
      the Internet, and the systematic collection of quantitative data. RESULTS:
      Analysis of ethnographic data yielded a typology of ibogaine scenes, "medical
      model", "lay provider/treatment guide", "activist/self-help", and
      "religious/spiritual". An estimated 3414 individuals had taken ibogaine as of
      February 2006, a fourfold increase relative to 5 years earlier, with 68% of the
      total having taken it for the treatment of a substance-related disorder, and 53% 
      specifically for opioid withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid withdrawal is the most
      common reason for which individuals took ibogaine. The focus on opioid withdrawal
      in the ibogaine subculture distinguishes ibogaine from other agents commonly
      termed "psychedelics", and is consistent with experimental research and case
      series evidence indicating a significant pharmacologically mediated effect of
      ibogaine in opioid withdrawal.

      drowning fatality and a myocardial abnormality (myocardial bridging). Samples of 
      blood, urine, bile, gastric content, liver, lungs, vitreous, spleen and hair were
      taken. Biological fluids were liquid-liquid extracted with saturated NH4Cl pH 9.5
      and methylene chloride/isopropanol (95/5, v/v) in presence of clonazepam-d(4),
      used as internal standard. After decontamination with dichloromethane, hair was
      cut into small pieces then sonicated for 2h in saturated NH4Cl pH 9.5 before
      extraction by methylene chloride/isopropanol (95/5, v/v). After evaporation the
      residues were reconstituted in methanol/ACN/formate buffer pH 3, from which 10
      microL were injected into an ODB Uptisphere C(18) column (150 mm x 2.1mm, 5
      microm) and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile and formate buffer delivered
      at a flow rate of 200 microL/min. A Quantum Ultra triple-quadrupole mass
      spectrometer was used for analyses. Ionization was achieved using electrospray in
      the positive ionization mode (ESI). For each compound, detection was related to
      three daughter ions (ibogaine: m/z 311.4-->122.1, 174.1 and 188.1; noribogaine:
      m/z 297.4-->122.1, 159.1 and 160.1; clonazepam-d(4): m/z 319.9-->218.1, 245.1 and
      274.1). Ibogaine and noribogaine were detected in all autopsy samples. Hair
      segmentation was not possible as hair was very short and frizzy. Concentrations
      of 1.2 and 2.5 ng/mg, respectively were detected. Neither other licit or illicit 
      drugs nor alcohol were found. The presence of ibogaine and noribogaine in all
      autopsy samples was consistent with the recent absorption of Tabernanthe iboga,
      which was assumed to be responsible of the drowning fatality. The history of
      exposure, regarding hair analysis, is discussed. LC-MS/MS appears to be the best 
      method for analyzing complex and poorly volatile alkaloids in autopsy samples and
      particularly in hair, due to the presence of a nitrogen ring and the relatively
      low concentrations to be measured.

TI  - Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous
      analysis of multiple hallucinogens, chlorpheniramine, ketamine, ritalinic acid,
      and metabolites, in urine.
PG  - 497-504
AB  - A validated method for the simultaneous analysis of multiple hallucinogens,
      chlorpheniramine, ketamine, ritalinic acid, and several metabolites is presented.
      The procedure comprises a sample clean-up step, using mixed-mode solid-phase
      extraction followed by liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry
      analysis. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Sunfire C(8) column
      eluted with a mixture of formate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile. The applied 
      LC gradient ensured the elution of all the drugs examined within 14 min and
      produced chromatographic peaks of acceptable symmetry. Selectivity of the method 
      was achieved by a combination of retention time and two precursor-product ion
      transitions for the non-deuterated analogues. Validation of the method was
      performed using 500 microL of urine. The limits of quantification (LOQ) for LSD
      and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD were 0.05 and 1 ng/mL, respectively, and ranged, for the 
      other hallucinogens, from 0.5 to 10 ng/mL. Linear and quadratic regression was
      observed from the LOQ of each compound to 12.5 ng/mL for LSD, 50 ng/mL for
      2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD and 500 ng/mL for the others (r(2) > 0.99). Precision for the
      QC samples, spiked at a minimum of two concentrations, was calculated [%CV and
      %bias < 20% for most of the compounds, except for bufotenine and cathinone (%bias
      < 24%), and ibogaine (%bias < 30%)]. Extraction was found to be both reproducible
      and efficient with recoveries > 87% for all the analytes. Furthermore, the
      processed samples were demonstrated to be stable in the autosampler for at least 
      24 h. Finally, the validated method was applied to the determination of
      chlorpheniramine, ketamine, LSD, and psilocin in authentic urine samples.

TI  - Ibogaine, a noncompetitive inhibitor of serotonin transport, acts by stabilizing 
      the cytoplasm-facing state of the transporter.
PG  - 29441-7
AB  - Ibogaine, a hallucinogenic alkaloid with purported anti-addiction properties,
      inhibited serotonin transporter (SERT) noncompetitively by decreasing V(max) with
      little change in the K(m) for serotonin (5-HT). Ibogaine also inhibited binding
      to SERT of the cocaine analog
      2beta-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-[(125)I]iodophenyl)tropane. However, inhibition of
      binding was competitive, increasing the apparent K(D) without much change in
      B(max). Ibogaine increased the reactivity of cysteine residues positioned in the 
      proposed cytoplasmic permeation pathway of SERT but not at nearby positions out
      of that pathway. In contrast, cysteines placed at positions in the extracellular 
      permeation pathway reacted at slower rates in the presence of ibogaine. These
      results are consistent with the proposal that ibogaine binds to and stabilizes
      the state of SERT from which 5-HT dissociates to the cytoplasm, in contrast with 
      cocaine, which stabilizes the state that binds extracellular 5-HT.

TI  - 18-MC acts in the medial habenula and interpeduncular nucleus to attenuate
      dopamine sensitization to morphine in the nucleus accumbens.
PG  - 547-60
AB  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a novel iboga alkaloid congener, is a potential
      treatment for drug addiction. 18-MC has been shown to decrease
      self-administration of drugs (e.g., morphine, methamphetamine, nicotine) and
      attenuate opioid withdrawal in rats. In previous studies, systemic pretreatment
      with 18-MC abolished the sensitized increase in accumbens dopamine levels induced
      by chronic morphine administration. In vitro studies have shown that 18-MC is a
      potent antagonist of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors, and alpha3beta4 antagonism 
      is believed to be the primary mechanism responsible for 18-MC's effects on drug
      self-administration and possibly on morphine-induced changes in mesolimbic
      dopamine. While there are very low densities of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors
      in the mesolimbic pathway, these receptors are prominently localized in the
      medial habenula (MHb) and in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). These nuclei and 
      the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway connecting them are believed to function as 
      part of an alternate reward pathway modulating the dopaminergic mesolimbic
      pathway known to be involved in drug addiction. In the present study, to
      determine if 18-MC acts in the MHb or in the IPN, the effects of local infusion
      of 18-MC into these brain areas were assessed on mesolimbic dopamine responses to
      acute and repeated morphine treatment. Administration of 18-MC (10 mug) into
      either the IPN or MHb blocked the sensitized dopamine response to repeated
      morphine in the nucleus accumbens; 18-MC had no effect on the dopamine response
      to acute morphine. The results suggest that 18-MC acts in the
      habenulo-interpeduncular pathway to modulate the effects of repeated morphine in 
      the dopaminergic mesolimbic system.

TI  - Synthesis of isoquinuclidine analogs of chloroquine: antimalarial and
      antileishmanial activity.
PG  - 3919-25
AB  - The isoquinuclidine (2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) ring system may be viewed as a
      semi-rigid boat form of the piperidine ring and, when properly substituted, a
      scaffold for rigid analogs of biologically active ethanolamines and
      propanolamines. It is present in natural products (such as ibogaine and
      dioscorine) that display interesting pharmacological properties. In this study,
      we have expanded our continuing efforts to incorporate this ring system in
      numerous pharmacophores, by designing and synthesizing semirigid analogs of the
      antimalarial drug chloroquine. The analogs were tested in vitro against
      Plasmodium falciparum strains and Leishmania donovani promastigote cultures.
      Compounds 6 and 13 displayed potent antimalarial activity against both
      chloroquine-susceptible D6 and the -resistant W2 strains of P. falciparum. All
      analogs also demonstrated significant antileishmanial activity with compounds 6
      and 13 again being the most potent. The fact that these compounds are active
      against both chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive strains as well as
      leishmanial cells makes them promising candidates for drug development.

TI  - Client and counselor attitudes toward the use of medications for treatment of
      opioid dependence.
PG  - 207-15
AB  - Attitudes, perceived social norms, and intentions were assessed for 376
      counselors and 1,083 clients from outpatient, methadone, and residential drug
      treatment programs regarding four medications used to treat opiate dependence:
      methadone, buprenorphine, clonidine, and ibogaine. Attitudes, social norms, and
      intentions to use varied by treatment modality. Methadone clients and counselors 
      had more positive attitudes toward the use of methadone, whereas their
      counterparts in residential and outpatient settings had neutral or negative
      assessments. Across modalities, attitudes, perceived social norms, and intentions
      toward the use of buprenorphine were relatively neutral. Assessments of clonidine
      and ibogaine were negative for clients and counselors in all settings. Social
      normative influences were dominant across settings and medications in determining
      counselor and client intentions to use medications, suggesting that perceptions
      about beliefs of peers may play a critical role in use of medications to treat
      opiate dependence.

TI  - The adverse effects of hallucinogens from intramural perspective.
PG  - 189-200
AB  - UNLABELLED: Very recently, after a long-lasting, worldwide moratorium on research
      of hallucinogenic agents, a good number of advanced countries have been revising 
      their position, and start to approve testing the physiological and therapeutic
      effects of hallucinogens in human subjects. The purpose of this article is to
      review safety information available in the literature on hallucinogen use, and
      sort out those data from the reported complications of their abuse. Because of
      prohibitory regulations of the last 35 years, there are difficulties in achieving
      this kind of evaluation. Our approach has to be broad, and at times
      retrospective, in contrast to the well-controlled, focused, prospective design of
      the premarketing trials of legal drugs. The article summarizes the analyses in
      anticipation of supportive regulatory changes for the use of hallucinogens in
      well controlled studies and strictly supervised clinical trials. KEYWORDS:
      adverse effects, ayahuasca, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, hallucinogenic agents,
      ibogaine, lysergic acid diethylamide, N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine,

TI  - Autophagy-mediated chemosensitizing effect of the plant alkaloid voacamine on
      multidrug resistant cells.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - In our previous studies, voacamine, a bisindolic alkaloid extracted from
      Peschiera fuchsiaefolia, was examined for its possible capability of enhancing
      the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin (DOX) on multidrug resistant (MDR) human
      osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS-R). Voacamine induced in resistant cells a significant
      increase of drug retention and intranuclear location which became comparable to
      those observed in the parental sensitive counterparts (U-2 OS-WT). In the present
      study, the cell survival analysis and the electron microscopic observations
      confirmed the evident cytotoxicity of DOX on MDR cells after pre-treatment with
      the plant extract. Moreover, an increase of the reactivity of P-glycoprotein
      (P-gp) with the monoclonal antibody UIC2, which recognizes an epitope of the drug
      transporter in its functional conformation, was revealed, demonstrating that
      voacamine is a substrate of P-gp, thus acting as a competitive antagonist of the 
      cytotoxic agent. Moreover, to investigate if the enhancement of the cytotoxic
      effect induced by voacamine could be due to an apoptotic process, we carried out 
      the analysis of cell morphology after Hoechst staining and the quantification of 
      apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC assay. These evaluations showed a very low rate of
      apoptosis in U-2 OS-R cells treated with voacamine and DOX given in association. 
      In addition, the combined treatment induced ultrastructural modifications
      suggestive of autophagic cell death. In particular, transmission electron
      microscopy observations revealed the presence of numerous lysosomes and the
      formation of a large number of autophagosomes containing residual digested
      material. In conclusion, these findings seem to indicate that voacamine is
      capable of enhancing the cytotoxic effect of DOX on MDR cells by favouring a
      lethal autophagic process.

TI  - Ibogaine affects brain energy metabolism.
PG  - 11-4
AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid present in the root of the plant Tabernanthe
      iboga. It is known to attenuate abstinence syndrome in animal models of drug
      addiction. Since the anti-addiction effect lasts longer than the presence of
      ibogaine in the body, some profound metabolic changes are expected. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the effect of ibogaine on protein expression in rat
      brains. Rats were treated with ibogaine at 20 mg/kg body weight i.p. and
      subsequently examined at 24 and 72 h. Proteins were extracted from whole brain
      and separated by two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis. Individual proteins were 
      identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Enzymes of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
      cycle namely glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase A, pyruvate
      kinase and malate dehydrogenase were induced. The results suggest that the
      remedial effect of ibogaine could be mediated by the change in energy
      availability. Since energy dissipating detoxification and reversion of tolerance 
      to different drugs of abuse requires underlying functional and structural changes
      in the cell, higher metabolic turnover would be favourable. Understanding the
      pharmacodynamics of anti-addiction drugs highlights the subcellular aspects of
      addiction diseases, in addition to neurological and psychological perspectives.

TI  - Autoregulation of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor expression:
      implications for the long-lasting actions of the anti-addiction drug, Ibogaine.
PG  - 2420-2
AB  - We recently showed that the up-regulation of the glial cell line-derived
      neurotrophic factor (GDNF) pathway in the midbrain, is the molecular mechanism by
      which the putative anti-addiction drug Ibogaine mediates its desirable action of 
      reducing alcohol consumption. Human reports and studies in rodents have shown
      that a single administration of Ibogaine results in a long-lasting reduction of
      drug craving (humans) and drug and alcohol intake (rodents). Here we determine
      whether, and how, Ibogaine exerts its long-lasting actions on GDNF expression and
      signaling. Using the dopaminergic-like SHSY5Y cell line as a culture model, we
      observed that short-term Ibogaine exposure results in a sustained increase in
      GDNF expression that is mediated via the induction of a long-lasting
      autoregulatory cycle by which GDNF positively regulates its own expression. We
      show that the initial exposure of cells to Ibogaine or GDNF results in an
      increase in GDNF mRNA, leading to protein expression and to the corresponding
      activation of the GDNF signaling pathway. This, in turn, leads to a further
      increase in the mRNA level of the growth factor. The identification of a
      GDNF-mediated, autoregulatory long-lasting feedback loop could have important
      implications for GDNF's potential value as a treatment for addiction and
      neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Sigma-1 receptor activation prevents intracellular calcium dysregulation in
      cortical neurons during in vitro ischemia.
PG  - 1355-65
AB  - Sigma receptors are putative targets for neuroprotection following ischemia;
      however, little is known on their mechanism of action. One of the key components 
      in the demise of neurons following ischemic injury is the disruption of
      intracellular calcium homeostasis. Fluorometric calcium imaging was used to
      examine the effects of sigma receptor activation on changes in intracellular
      calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) evoked by in vitro ischemia in cultured
      cortical neurons from embryonic rats. The sigma receptor agonist,
      1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine (DTG), was shown to depress [Ca(2+)](i) elevations
      observed in response to ischemia induced by sodium azide and glucose deprivation.
      Two sigma receptor antagonists, metaphit
      [1-(1-(3-isothiocyanatophenyl)-cyclohexyl)-piperidine] and BD-1047
      (N-[2-3,4-dichlorophenyl)-ethyl]-N-methyl-2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine), were
      shown to blunt the ability of DTG to inhibit ischemia-evoked increases in
      [Ca(2+)](i), revealing that the effects are mediated by activation of sigma
      receptors and not via the actions of DTG on nonspecific targets such as
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. DTG inhibition of ischemia-induced increases in
      [Ca(2+)](i) was mimicked by the sigma-1 receptor-selective agonists,
      carbetapentane, (+)-pentazocine and PRE-084 [2-(4-morpholinethyl)
      1-phenylcyclohexanecarboxylate hydrochloride], but not by the sigma-2-selective
      agonist, ibogaine, showing that activation of sigma-1 receptors is responsible
      for the effects. In contrast, DTG, carbetapentane, and ibogaine blocked
      spontaneous, synchronous calcium transients observed in our preparation at
      concentrations consistent with sigma receptor-mediated effects, indicating that
      both sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors regulate events that affect [Ca(2+)](i) in
      cortical neurons. Our studies show that activation of sigma receptors can
      ameliorate [Ca(2+)](i) dysregulation associated with ischemia in cortical neurons
      and, thus, identify one of the mechanisms by which these receptors may exert
      their neuroprotective properties.

TI  - Modulation of high alcohol drinking in the inbred Fawn-Hooded (FH/Wjd) rat
      strain: implications for treatment.
PG  - 356-73
AB  - The Fawn-Hooded rat (FH/Wjd) is an inbred alcohol-preferring rat strain, unlike
      most of the other strains that were selectively bred for high alcohol intake and 
      preference. It was chosen for study some 16 years ago because of a reported
      mutation that disrupted platelet serotonin function. Although the FH/Wjd rat has 
      high alcohol intake (>5 g/kg/day) and preference (>65%), interbreeding with an
      alcohol-non-preferring inbred strain suggested that these measures are unrelated 
      to the serotonin abnormality. Similarly, the exaggerated immobility of the FH/Wjd
      rats in the forced swim test did not correlate with the high alcohol intake. Many
      compounds have been tested in the FH/Wjd rats after both acute and chronic
      treatment and a substantial number of them have proved effective. However, as the
      case with opiate antagonists, tolerance to the effects of the drug can develop.
      An up-regulation of opioid receptors accompanied the chronic treatment and this
      mechanism may account for the development of tolerance. Tolerance to opiate
      antagonists has also been demonstrated in two of the selectively bred
      alcohol-preferring rat lines, but it is unknown whether this process may
      contribute to the relapses seen in individuals being treated with naltrexone.
      Other drugs that reliably decrease alcohol intake in the FH/Wjd rats include the 
      5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor antagonist, amperozide, the mGlu5 receptor
      antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) and herbal
      derivatives such as ibogaine, St. John's wort and kudzu extract. Thus, studies in
      the FH/Wjd rat have led to the discovery of a wide variety of targets for the
      development of novel agents to treat alcoholism. The fact that several of these
      drugs were shown to reduce alcohol intake in some of the selectively bred
      alcohol-preferring rat lines and/or alcohol-preferring vervet monkeys increases
      our confidence that they are good candidates for further development.

TI  - Distribution of ibogaine and noribogaine in a man following a poisoning involving
      root bark of the Tabernanthe iboga shrub.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - In the present paper, we report for the first time the tissue distribution of
      ibogaine and noribogaine, the main metabolite of ibogaine, in a 48-year-old
      Caucasian male, with a history of drug abuse, found dead at his home after a
      poisoning involving the ingestion of root bark from the shrub Tabernanthe iboga. 
      Ibogaine and noribogaine were quantified in tissues and fluids using a fully
      validated liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry method. Apart from
      cardiac tissue, ibogaine and noribogaine were identified in all matrices
      investigated. The highest concentrations were found in spleen, liver, brain, and 
      lung. The tissue/subclavian blood concentration ratios averaged 1.78, 3.75, 1.16,
      and 4.64 for ibogaine and 0.83, 2.43, 0.90, and 2.69 for noribogaine for spleen, 
      liver, brain, and lung, respectively. Very low concentrations of the two drugs
      were found in the prostatic tissue. Both ibogaine and noribogaine are secreted in
      the bile and cross the blood-brain barrier. Four other compounds were detected in
      most of the studied matrices. One of them was identified as ibogamine.
      Unfortunately, we were not able to positively identify the other three compounds 
      because of the unavailability of reference substances. Two of them could possibly
      be attributed to the following oxidation products: iboluteine and
      desmethoxyiboluteine. The third compound could be ibogaline.

TI  - Liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry determination of ibogaine
      and noribogaine in human plasma and whole blood. Application to a poisoning
      involving Tabernanthe iboga root.
PG  - 131-41
AB  - A liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS)
      method was developed for the first time for the determination of ibogaine and
      noribogaine in human plasma and whole blood. The method involved solid phase
      extraction of the compounds and the internal standard (fluorescein) from the two 
      matrices using OasisHLB columns. LC separation was performed on a Zorbax eclipse 
      XD8 C8 column (5 microm) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile containing 0.02%
      (v/v) trimethylamine and 2mM ammonium formate buffer. MS data were acquired in
      single ion monitoring mode at m/z 311.2, 297.2 and 332.5 for ibogaine,
      noribogaine and fluorescein, respectively. The drug/internal standard peak area
      ratios were linked via a quadratic relationship to plasma (0.89-179 microg/l for 
      ibogaine; 1-200 microg/l for noribogaine) and to whole blood concentrations
      (1.78-358 microg/kg for ibogaine; 2-400 microg/kg for noribogaine). Precision
      ranged from 4.5 to 13% and accuracy was 89-102%. Dilution of the samples had no
      influence on the performance of the method. Extraction recoveries were > or =94% 
      in plasma and > or =57% in whole blood. The lower limits of quantitation were
      0.89 microg/l for ibogaine and 1 microg/l for noribogaine in plasma, and 1.78
      microg/kg for ibogaine and 2 microg/kg for noribogaine in whole blood. In frozen 
      plasma samples, the two drugs were stable for at least 1 year. In blood, ibogaine
      and noribogaine were stable for 4h at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C and 2 months
      at -20 degrees C. The method was successfully used for the analysis of a
      poisoning involving Tabernanthe iboga root.

PG  - 758-65
AB  - Microwave assisted Diels-Alder cycloaddition of 5-Br-N-benzylpyridinone (2) with 
      methyl acrylate is described to gain an easy access to
      7-bromo-2-benzyl-3-oxo-2-aza-5 or 6-carbomethoxy bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-7-enes
      (3)-(6). The preparation of the ibogaine analogue
      20-desethyl-(20-endo)-hydroxymethyl-11-demethoxyibogaine (17) is described by
      stereoselective hydrogenation of the C(7)-C(8) double bond. Biological evaluation
      showed an interesting in vitro binding profile toward dopamine transporter,
      serotonin transporter and opioid receptor systems accompanied by an
      antiwithdrawal effect in mice for hydroxymethyl
      7-indolyl-2-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (14). The simplification of the ibogaine 
      structure appears as a promising approach toward the design of compounds that
      could reduce the withdrawal symptoms.

TI  - Fatalities after taking ibogaine in addiction treatment could be related to
      sudden cardiac death caused by autonomic dysfunction.
PG  - 960-4
AB  - Ibogaine is the most important alkaloid of the Central African Iboga-shrub. It is
      the central drug in Gabonian initiation ceremonies in which it is used to cause a
      near-death experience. In Western countries it is used in private clinics to
      treat addiction. However, in the United States and most European countries it is 
      classified as an illegal drug because at least eight persons have died after
      having taken Ibogaine. These fatalities occurred in most cases several days after
      ingestion or following the intake of very small doses. There is no conclusive
      explanation at the present time for these deaths. We hypothesize, that these
      deaths may be a result of cardiac arrhythmias, caused by a dysregulation of the
      autonomic nervous system. Ibogaine affects the autonomic nervous system by
      influencing several neurotransmitter-systems and the fastigial nucleus. The
      cerebellar nucleus responds to small doses with a stimulation of the sympathetic 
      system, leading to a fight or flight reaction. High doses, however, lead to a
      vagal dominance: a "feigned death". The risk of cardiac arrhythmias is increased 
      in situations of sympathetic stimulation or coincidence of a high parasympathetic
      tonus and a left-sided sympathetic stimulation. This could occur under influence 
      of small doses of ibogaine and also at times of exhaustion with a high vagal
      tonus, when sudden fear reactions could cause a critical left-sided sympathetic
      stimulation. Gabonian healers prevent these risks by isolating their patients
      from normal life and by inducing a trance-state with right-hemispheric and vagal 
      dominance for several days.

TI  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine acts in the medial habenula and/or interpeduncular nucleus
      to decrease morphine self-administration in rats.
PG  - 94-8
AB  - The novel iboga alkaloid congener 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) is a putative
      anti-addictive agent that has been shown, in rats, to decrease the
      self-administration of morphine and other drugs of abuse. Previous work has
      established that 18-MC is a potent antagonist at alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors.
      Because alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors in the brain are preferentially located
      in the medial habenula and the interpeduncular nucleus, the present study was
      conducted to determine if 18-MC could act in these brain areas to modulate
      morphine self-administration in rats. Local administration of 18-MC into either
      the medial habenula or the interpeduncular area decreased morphine
      self-administration while having no effect on responding for a non-drug
      reinforcer (sucrose). Similar results were produced by local administration into 
      the same brain areas of two other alpha3beta4 nicotinic antagonists, mecamylamine
      and alpha-conotoxin AuIB. Local administration of 18-MC into the ventral
      tegmental area had no effect on morphine self-administration. These and other
      data are consistent with the hypothesis that 18-MC decreases morphine
      self-administration by blocking alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors in the
      habenulo-interpeduncular pathway.

TI  - GDNF and addiction.
PG  - 277-85
AB  - Biochemical adaptations to drugs of abuse and alcohol are especially profound in 
      midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Long-lasting molecular and structural changes in
      mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons that result from chronic exposure to drugs of
      abuse and alcohol are thought to underlie adverse behaviors such as compulsive
      drug seeking and relapse. Recent studies suggest that a subset of these changes
      is prevented/reversed by activation of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
      factor (GDNF) signaling pathway. Behavioral effects of drugs of abuse such as
      cocaine and alcohol are also negatively regulated by GDNF: inhibition of the
      endogenous GDNF pathway enhances the activity of drugs of abuse, while
      administration of GDNF reduces the severity of the effects. In this review, we
      summarize the data implicating GDNF as a negative regulator of drug and alcohol
      addiction. We also provide evidence to suggest that therapies that activate GDNF 
      signaling may be useful for the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction.

TI  - Complementary medicines in psychiatry: review of effectiveness and safety.
PG  - 109-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary medicines in those with mental health
      problems is well documented. However, their effectiveness is often not
      established and they may be less harmless than commonly assumed. AIMS: To review 
      the complementary medicines routinely encountered in psychiatric practice, their 
      effectiveness, potential adverse effects and interactions. METHOD: Electronic and
      manual literature search on the effectiveness and safety of psychotropic
      complementary medicines. RESULTS: Potentially useful substances include ginkgo
      and hydergine as cognitive enhancers, passion flower and valerian as sedatives,
      St John's wort and s-adenosylmethionine as antidepressants, and selenium and
      folate to complement antidepressants. The evidence is less conclusive for the use
      of omega-3 fatty acids as augmentation treatment in schizophrenia, melatonin for 
      tardive dyskinesia and 18-methoxycoronaridine, an ibogaine derivative, for the
      treatment of cocaine and heroin addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic clinical
      trials are needed to test promising substances. Meanwhile, those wishing to take 
      psychotropic complementary medicines require appropriate advice.

TI  - Natural medicines for alcoholism treatment: a review.
PG  - 525-36
AB  - Alcoholism is a serious problem throughout the world. The development of
      alcoholism remedies have medical, social and economical significance. In view of 
      the pitfalls of psychological dependence and adverse behavioural effects of
      synthetic drugs, the development of low toxicity and high efficiency medicines
      derived from natural products exhibits expansive market prospects. Based on these
      considerations, we summarize briefly folk application of traditional hangover
      remedies and clinical application of herbal complex and patent medicines for
      alcoholism treatment. We have reviewed the effects of natural medicines on
      intake, absorption and metabolism of alcohol, as well as the protective effects
      on alcohol-induced acute and chronic tissue injury.

TI  - Attenuation of morphine withdrawal signs by intracerebral administration of
      18-methoxycoronaridine.
PG  - 98-104
AB  - 18-Methoxyroconaridine (18-MC), a synthetic derivative of ibogaine, reduces
      morphine self-administration and alleviates several signs of acute opioid
      withdrawal in rats. Although there is already well documented evidence of the
      mechanism mediating 18-MC's action to reduce the rewarding effects of morphine,
      nothing is known about the mechanism responsible for 18-MC's attenuation of
      opioid withdrawal. In vitro studies have demonstrated that 18-MC is a potent
      antagonist of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors (IC50=0.75 microM), which are
      predominantly located in the medial habenula and interpeduncular nuclei. Previous
      work indicating that alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors mediate 18-MC's effects on
      drug self-administration prompted us to assess whether brain areas having high or
      moderate densities of alpha3beta4 receptors might be involved in 18-MC's
      modulation of opioid withdrawal. To test this possibility, 18-MC was locally
      administered into the medial habenula, interpeduncular nucleus and locus
      coeruleus of morphine-dependent rats; this treatment was followed by naltrexone
      to precipitate a withdrawal syndrome. Pretreatment with various doses of 18-MC
      into the locus coeruleus significantly reduced wet-dog shakes, teeth chattering, 
      burying and diarrhea, while pretreatment into the medial habenula attenuated
      teeth chattering, burying, and weight loss. Some doses of 18-MC administered into
      the interpeduncular nucleus significantly ameliorated rearing, teeth chattering, 
      and burying, while other doses exacerbated diarrhea and teeth chattering. The
      present findings suggest that 18-MC may act in all three nuclei to suppress
      various signs of opioid withdrawal.

TI  - Voacamine, an alkaloid extracted from Peschiera fuchsiaefolia, inhibits
      P-glycoprotein action in multidrug-resistant tumor cells.
PG  - 1597-603
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumor cells is generally associated with increased 
      efflux of the cytotoxic compounds, due to the activation of mechanisms of
      intracellular transport and to the overexpression of surface proteins, such as
      P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which act as ATP-dependent molecular pumps. In a previous
      study, voacamine, a bisindolic alkaloid from Peschiera fuchsiaefolia, was
      examined for its possible capability of enhancing the cytotoxic effect of
      doxorubicin (DOX) on resistant human osteosarcoma cells. The effects of voacamine
      on the cell survival and on accumulation of DOX were investigated on both the
      parental cell line, U-2 OS-WT, and its resistant counterpart, U-2 OS-R. A
      differential effect between sensitive and resistant cells on the intracellular
      DOX concentration and distribution was revealed. In particular, voacamine induced
      a significant increase of drug retention and intranuclear location in resistant
      cells. Moreover, the cell survival analysis and the electron microscopic
      observations revealed an enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of DOX induced by
      the plant extract. In the present study, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs),
      recognizing different and specific structural and functional state of Pgp, was
      used. By flow cytometry and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, a
      dose-dependent increase of the reactivity of Pgp with MAb UIC2, which
      specifically recognizes an epitope of the drug transporter in its functional
      conformation, was detected in voacamine-treated U-2 OS-R cells. Conversely, the
      expression of the epitope recognized by MAb MC57 was downregulated while MAb
      MM4.17 did not change its binding level to treated and untreated MDR cells. These
      data suggest that the plant extract reacts with Pgp producing conformational
      changes with consequent epitope modulation. Taken together, our observations seem
      to demonstrate that voacamine is a substrate for Pgp and, therefore, interferes
      with the Pgp-mediated drug export, acting as a competitive antagonist of
      cytotoxic agents.

TI  - Nicotinic agonists, antagonists, and modulators from natural sources.
PG  - 513-52
AB  - 1. Acetylcholine receptors were initially defined as nicotinic or muscarinic,
      based on selective activation by two natural products, nicotine and muscarine.
      Several further nicotinic agonists have been discovered from natural sources,
      including cytisine, anatoxin, ferruginine, anabaseine, epibatidine, and
      epiquinamide. These have provided lead structures for the design of a wide range 
      of synthetic agents. 2. Natural sources have also provided competitive nicotinic 
      antagonists, such as the Erythrina alkaloids, the tubocurarines, and
      methyllycaconitine. Noncompetitive antagonists, such as the histrionicotoxins,
      various izidines, decahydroquinolines, spiropyrrolizidine oximes,
      pseudophrynamines, ibogaine, strychnine, cocaine, and sparteine have come from
      natural sources. Finally, galanthamine, codeine, and ivermectin represent
      positive modulators of nicotinic function, derived from natural sources. 3.
      Clearly, research on acetylcholine receptors and functions has been dependent on 
      key natural products and the synthetic agents that they inspired.

TI  - Quantitation of ibogaine and 12-hydroxyibogamine in human plasma by liquid
      chromatography with fluorimetric detection.
PG  - 285-93
AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with fluorimetric
      detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of ibogaine and
      noribogaine in human plasma using fluorescein as internal standard. This method
      involved a solid phase extraction of the compounds from plasma using
      N-vinylpyrrolidone-divinybenzene copolymer cartridges. Separation of the three
      analytes was performed on a reversed-phase Supelcosil C18 analytical column (75
      mm x 4.6mm i.d., 3 microm particle size). The excitation wavelength was set at
      230 nm for the first 15.8min and then at 440 nm for the following 14.2 min; the
      emission wavelength was set at 336 nm for the first 15.8 min and then at 514 nm
      for the following 14.2 min. Obtained from the method validation, inter-assay
      precision was 6.0-12.5% and accuracy was 95.4-104%. The extraction efficiencies
      of the assay were higher than 94% and were constant across the calibration range.
      The lower limits of quantitation were 0.89 ng/ml for ibogaine and 1 ng/ml for
      noribogaine; at these levels, precision was < or =17% and accuracy was 95-105%.
      In this paper, extensive stability testing was undertaken using a wide range of
      storage conditions. Special attention must be paid to sample handling to avoid
      light degradation of the compounds.

TI  - Ibogaine reduces organ colonization in murine systemic and gastrointestinal
      Candida albicans infections.
PG  - 647-53
AB  - In the present study the effect of the indole alkaloid ibogaine on the in vitro
      lipolytic activity and adherence to epithelial cells of Candida albicans was
      investigated. The substance was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg 
      kg(-1) day(-1) in mice with disseminated and gastrointestinal C. albicans
      infections. Ibogaine significantly decreased the rate of mortality and the number
      of C. albicans c.f.u. recovered from the kidney, liver and spleen. Ibogaine
      interfered with the early stages of both disseminated and gastrointestinal C.
      albicans infections but did not reduce the number of C. albicans c.f.u. in the
      organs at the late phase of infections. The development of a specific immune
      response was not influenced by ibogaine, since the delayed-type hypersensitivity 
      reaction to C. albicans and the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma were similar
      in control and ibogaine-treated mice. The combined use of amphotericin B plus
      ibogaine in the treatment of mice with gastrointestinal infection reduced organ
      colonization more strongly than each substance alone.

TI  - sigma Receptor activation blocks potassium channels and depresses
      neuroexcitability in rat intracardiac neurons.
PG  - 1387-96
AB  - The sigma receptors have been implicated in the regulation of the cardiovascular 
      system, and sigma-1 receptor transcripts have been found in parasympathetic
      intracardiac neurons. However, the cellular function of sigma-1 receptors in
      these cells remains to be determined. Effects of sigma receptor activation on
      voltage-activated K(+) channels and action potential firing were studied in
      isolated intracardiac neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques. 
      Activation of sigma receptors reversibly blocked delayed outwardly rectifying
      potassium channels, large conductance Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels, and the
      M-current with maximal inhibition >80%. The inhibition of K(+) channels by sigma 
      ligands was dose-dependent, and the rank order potency of (+)-pentazocine >
      ibogaine > 1,3-di-O-tolyguanidin (DTG) suggests that the effect is mediated by
      sigma-1 receptor activation. Preincubation of neurons with the irreversible sigma
      receptor antagonist metaphit blocked DTG-induced inhibition of K(+) channels,
      confirming that the effect is mediated by sigma receptor activation. Although
      bath application of sigma ligands depolarized intracardiac neurons, the number of
      action potentials fired by the cells in response to depolarizing current pulses
      was decreased in the presence of these drugs. Neither dialysis of the neurons nor
      application of intracellular 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) trilithium salt inhibited
      the effect of sigma receptors on K(+) channels, which suggests that the signal
      transduction pathway does not involve a diffusible cytosolic second messenger or 
      a G protein. Together, these data suggest that sigma-1 receptors are directly
      coupled to K(+) channels in intracardiac neurons. Furthermore, activation of
      sigma-1 receptors depresses the excitability of intracardiac neurons and is thus 
      likely to block parasympathetic input to the heart.

TI  - Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor mediates the desirable actions of the
      anti-addiction drug ibogaine against alcohol consumption.
PG  - 619-28
AB  - Alcohol addiction manifests as uncontrolled drinking despite negative
      consequences. Few medications are available to treat the disorder. Anecdotal
      reports suggest that ibogaine, a natural alkaloid, reverses behaviors associated 
      with addiction including alcoholism; however, because of side effects, ibogaine
      is not used clinically. In this study, we first characterized the actions of
      ibogaine on ethanol self-administration in rodents. Ibogaine decreased ethanol
      intake by rats in two-bottle choice and operant self-administration paradigms.
      Ibogaine also reduced operant self-administration of ethanol in a relapse model. 
      Next, we identified a molecular mechanism that mediates the desirable activities 
      of ibogaine on ethanol intake. Microinjection of ibogaine into the ventral
      tegmental area (VTA), but not the substantia nigra, reduced self-administration
      of ethanol, and systemic administration of ibogaine increased the expression of
      glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in a midbrain region that
      includes the VTA. In dopaminergic neuron-like SHSY5Y cells, ibogaine treatment
      upregulated the GDNF pathway as indicated by increases in phosphorylation of the 
      GDNF receptor, Ret, and the downstream kinase, ERK1 (extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase 1). Finally, the ibogaine-mediated decrease in ethanol
      self-administration was mimicked by intra-VTA microinjection of GDNF and was
      reduced by intra-VTA delivery of anti-GDNF neutralizing antibodies. Together,
      these results suggest that GDNF in the VTA mediates the action of ibogaine on
      ethanol consumption. These findings highlight the importance of GDNF as a new
      target for drug development for alcoholism that may mimic the effect of ibogaine 
      against alcohol consumption but avoid the negative side effects.

TI  - Anti-HIV-1 activity of the Iboga alkaloid congener 18-methoxycoronaridine.
PG  - 808-12
AB  - The Iboga alkaloid congener 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) exhibits in vitro
      leishmanicidal and in vivo anti-addiction properties. In this paper, we describe 
      that 18-MC inhibits HIV-1 infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that 18-MC inhibits the
      replication of primary isolates of HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner, regardless
      of the preferential chemokine receptor usage of the isolates, at non-cell-toxic
      concentrations. The antiretroviral activity of 18-MC resulted in EC (50) values
      of 22.5 +/- 4.7 microM and 23 +/- 4.5 microM for R5 and X4 isolates,
      respectively, in PBMCs, and a therapeutic index (TI) of 14.5. Similar findings
      were observed for inhibition of HIV-1 replication in macrophages: EC (50) equal
      to 12.8 +/- 5 microM and 9.5 +/- 3 microM for an R5 virus after 14 and 21 days of
      infection, respectively, with TI equal to 25.6 and 34.5. 18-MC moderately
      inhibits the HIV-1 enzyme reverse transcriptase (IC (50) = 69.4 microM), which at
      least partially explains its antiretroviral activity.

TI  - Combating substance abuse with ibogaine: pre- and posttreatment recommendations
      and an example of successive model fitting analyses.
PG  - 191-9
AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid derived from the root bark of the African shrub
      Tabernan the iboga and it has been used for many years as a medicinal and
      ceremonial agent in West Central Africa. Furthermore, both anecdotal observations
      and recent studies suggest that ibogaine alleviates withdrawal symptoms and
      reduces drug cravings. Although ibogaine articles typically include information
      bearing on the duration of drug abstinence following treatment, little if any
      attention is given to the psychological and environmental factors that might
      facilitate a positive treatment outcome. Hence, a major purpose of the present
      review is to suggest a number of theory-driven, pretreatment and posttreatment
      recommendations that have good potential for enhancing ibogaine's effectiveness. 
      The second major purpose of this review is to demonstrate, through a reanalysis
      of previously published results, the utility of conducting successive model
      fitting analyses on ibogaine treatment data. Such analyses are useful for
      determining both the strength and form of the association between pre-ibogaine
      treatment variables and post-ibogaine treatment outcomes. Finally, in order to
      facilitate future quantitative reviews, the authors recommend that a minimum set 
      of patient- and treatment-related variables be included in all ibogaine
      publications involving human participants.

TI  - Administration of a non-NMDA antagonist, GYKI 52466, increases excitotoxic
      Purkinje cell degeneration caused by ibogaine.
PG  - 373-83
AB  - Ibogaine is a tremorigenic hallucinogen that has been proposed for clinical use
      in treating addiction. We previously reported that ibogaine, administered
      systemically, produces degeneration of a subset of Purkinje cells in the
      cerebellum, primarily within the vermis. Ablation of the inferior olive affords
      protection against ibogaine-induced neurotoxicity leading to the interpretation
      that ibogaine itself is not directly toxic to Purkinje cells. We postulated that 
      ibogaine produces sustained excitation of inferior olivary neurons that leads to 
      excessive glutamate release at climbing fiber terminals, causing subsequent
      excitotoxic injury to Purkinje cells. The neuronal degeneration induced by
      ibogaine provides an animal model for studying excitotoxic injury in order to
      analyze the contribution of glutamate receptors to this injury and to evaluate
      neuroprotective strategies. Since non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors
      mediate Purkinje cell excitation by climbing fibers, we hypothesized that
      1-4-aminophenyl-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI-52466),
      which antagonizes non-NMDA receptors, may have a neuroprotective effect by
      blocking glutamatergic excitation at climbing fiber synapses. To test this
      hypothesis, rats were administered systemic ibogaine plus GYKI-52466 and the
      degree of neuronal injury was analyzed in cerebellar sections. The results
      indicate that the AMPA antagonist GYKI-52466 (10 mg/kg i.p. x 3) does not protect
      against Purkinje cell injury at the doses used. Rather, co-administration of
      GYKI-52466 with ibogaine produces increased toxicity evidenced by more extensive 
      Purkinje cell degeneration. Several hypotheses that may underlie this result are 
      discussed. Although the reason for the increased toxicity found in this study is 
      not fully explained, the present results show that a non-NMDA antagonist can
      produce increased excitotoxic injury under some conditions. Therefore, caution
      should be exercised before employing glutamate antagonists to reduce the risk of 
      neuronal damage in human clinical disorders. Moreover, the contribution of
      different glutamate receptors to excitotoxic injury is complex and merits further
      analysis.

TI  - Novel iboga alkaloid congeners block nicotinic receptors and reduce drug
      self-administration.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine, a novel iboga alkaloid congener, reduces drug
      self-administration in animal models of addiction. Previously, we proposed that
      these effects are mediated by the ability of 18-methoxycoronaridine to inhibit
      nicotinic alpha3beta4 acetylcholine receptors. In an attempt to identify more
      potent 18-methoxycoronaridine analogs, we have tested a series of
      18-methoxycoronaridine congeners by whole-cell patch clamp recording of HEK 293
      cells expressing recombinant nicotinic alpha3beta4 receptors or glutamate
      NR1/NR2B N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The congeners exhibited a range
      of inhibitory potencies at alpha3beta4 receptors. Five congeners had IC(50)
      values similar to 18-methoxycoronaridine, and all of these were ineffective at
      NMDA receptors. The congeners also retained their ability to reduce morphine and 
      methamphetamine self-administration. These data are consistent with the
      importance of nicotinic alpha3beta4 receptors as a therapeutic target to modulate
      drug seeking. These compounds may constitute a new class of synthetic agents that
      act via the nicotinic alpha3beta4 mechanism to combat addiction.

AB  - The review of scientific literature, concerning the indol alkaloid Ibogaine,
      which is extracted from the bush Tabernanthe Iboga, is presented in this article.
      Used as a stimulating factor for hundred of years in non-traditional medicine,
      this alkaloid could be important for modern pharmacology because of potential
      anti-addictive properties. The mechanism of action of this alkaloid is closely
      related to different neurotransmitting systems. Studies with animals allow
      concluding that Ibogaine or medicines based on this alkaloid can be used for
      treatment of drug dependencies.

TI  - Differential effects of ibogaine on local cerebral glucose utilization in
      drug-naive and morphine-dependent rats.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - Ibogaine, a hallucinogenic indole alkaloid, has been proposed as a treatment for 
      addiction to opioids and other drugs of abuse. The mechanism for its putative
      anti-addictive effects is unknown. In this study, the effects of ibogaine on
      local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) were determined in freely moving,
      drug-naive, or morphine-dependent adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats using the
      [(14)C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) method. Morphine-dependent rats were treated with
      increasing doses of morphine (5-25 mg/kg, s.c., b.i.d.) and then maintained at 25
      mg/kg (b.i.d.) for 4-7 days. For the 2-DG procedure, rats were injected with
      saline or ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.). 2-DG was administered 1 h after
      administration of ibogaine. The rate of LCGU was determined by quantitative
      autoradiography in 46 brain regions. In drug-naive animals, ibogaine produced
      significant increases in LCGU in the parietal, cingulate, and occipital cortices 
      and cerebellum compared to controls consistent with its activity as a
      hallucinogen and a tremorogen. Morphine-dependent rats had only minor alterations
      in LCGU at the time assessed in this experiment. However, in morphine-dependent
      animals, ibogaine produced a global decrease in LCGU that was greatest in brain
      regions such as the lateral and medial preoptic areas, nucleus of the diagonal
      band, nucleus accumbens shell, inferior colliculus, locus coeruleus, and
      flocculus compared to morphine-dependent animals treated with saline. These
      findings indicate that ibogaine produces distinctly different effects on LCGU in 
      drug-naive and morphine-dependent rats. This suggests that different mechanisms
      may underlie ibogaine's hallucinogenic and anti-addictive effects.

TI  - Voacamine, a bisindolic alkaloid from Peschiera fuchsiaefolia, enhances the
      cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on multidrug-resistant tumor cells.
PG  - 1505-13
AB  - Multidrug-resistance (MDR) is largely caused by the efflux of therapeutics from
      the tumor cell by means of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), resulting in reduced efficacy
      of the chemotherapy. In order to overcome MDR, substances, such as verapamil and 
      cyclosporin A (CsA), were employed. As these P-gp modulating agents did not seem 
      promising in clinical practice, new compounds with a low degree of undesirable
      side effects, were introduced. In this study, bisindolic alkaloid voacamine was
      examined for its possible capability of enhancing the cytotoxic effect of
      doxorubicin (DOX) on drug resistant cells. Two different pairs of tumor cell
      lines were analyzed: the parental lymphoblastoid cell line CEM-WT and its MDR
      derivative CEM-R, the parental osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS-WT and its resistant
      counterpart U-2 OS-R. These cell lines were characterized for their morphological
      features by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and for the expression of the main
      drug transporters by flow cytometric analysis. The effects of voacamine on the
      cell survival and on both accumulation and efflux of DOX were then investigated. 
      The intracellular distribution of DOX, given alone or in association with CsA or 
      voacamine, was observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. A differential
      effect of voacamine between sensitive and resistant cells on the intracellular
      DOX concentration and distribution was shown. In particular, voacamine induced a 
      significant increase of drug retention and intranuclear location in resistant
      cells. The results of cell survival experiments revealed an enhancement of the
      cytotoxic effect of DOX induced by voacamine, confirmed by evident morphological 
      changes observed by SEM. These findings suggest promising applications of this
      natural substance against MDR tumors.

TI  - Treatment of allergic rhinitis: H1-antihistamines and intranasal steroids.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - Allergic rhinitis is charterized as an inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa. 
      In clinical practice, H(1)-antihistamines and topical corticosteroids are most
      commonly used pharmacological agents for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The 
      beneficial effects of steroids depend upon their long-term anti-inflammatory
      effect rather than upon direct receptor antagonism. This is different to
      H(1)-antihistamines, which block both neural and vascular H(1) receptors and have
      a clinical effect on symptoms such as nasal itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea.
      H(1)-antihistamines are rapidly absorbed and most of them are metabolized by the 
      hepatic cytochrome P system and begin to reduce nasal symptoms (itching and
      sneezing) within one hour. Understanding of both the efficacy and the
      pharmacological properties of these commonly used drugs in the treatment of nasal
      allergic inflammation and its related nasal symptoms is very important. From a
      clinical viewpoint, it will provide a useful guideline for an appropriate use of 
      these drugs.

TI  - Ibogaine attenuation of morphine withdrawal in mice: role of glutamate
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.
PG  - 781-5
AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is an alkaloid with putative antiaddictive properties, alleviating
      opiates dependence and withdrawal. The glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      receptors have been implicated in the physiological basis of drug addiction;
      accordingly, IBO acts as a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist. The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the effects of IBO on naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome 
      in morphine-dependent mice, focusing on the role of NMDA receptors. Jumping, a
      major behavioral expression of such withdrawal, was significantly (P<.01)
      inhibited by IBO (40 and 80 mg/kg, 64.2% and 96.9% inhibition, respectively) and 
      MK-801 (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg, 67.3% and 97.7%, respectively) given prior to
      naloxone. Coadministration of the lower doses of IBO (40 mg/kg) and MK-801 (0.15 
      mg/kg) results in 94.7% inhibition of jumping, comparable to the effects of
      higher doses of either IBO or MK-801. IBO and MK-801 also significantly inhibited
      NMDA-induced (99.0% and 71.0%, respectively) jumping when given 30 min (but not
      24 h) prior to NMDA in nonaddictive mice. There were no significant differences
      in [3H]MK-801 binding to cortical membranes from naive animals,
      morphine-dependent animals, or morphine-dependent animals treated with IBO or
      MK-801. This study provides further evidence that IBO does have an inhibitory
      effect on opiate withdrawal symptoms and suggests that the complex process
      resulting in morphine withdrawal includes an IBO-sensitive functional and
      transitory alteration of NMDA receptor.

TI  - Anti-addictive actions of an iboga alkaloid congener: a novel mechanism for a
      novel treatment.
PG  - 607-18
AB  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a novel iboga alkaloid congener that decreases
      drug self-administration in several animal models, may be a potential treatment
      for multiple forms of drug abuse. In animal models, 18-MC reduced intravenous
      morphine, cocaine, methamphetamine and nicotine self-administration, oral alcohol
      and nicotine intake, and attenuated signs of opioid withdrawal, but had no effect
      on responding for a nondrug reinforcer (water) and produced no apparent toxicity 
      [Brain Res. 719 (1996) 29; NeuroReport 11 (2000) 2013; Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav.
      58 (1997) 615; Psychopharmacology (Berl.) 139 (1998) 274; NeuroReport 9 (1998)
      1283; Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 914 (2000) 369]. Consistent with a relationship among
      drug sensitization, mesolimbic dopamine, and drug-seeking behavior, 18-MC also
      blocked the sensitized dopamine responses to morphine and cocaine in the nucleus 
      accumbens. An extensive series of receptor studies showed that 18-MC was most
      potent and somewhat selective as an antagonist at alpha3beta4 nicotinic
      receptors. Low-dose combinations of 18-MC with other drugs known to have this
      same action (e.g., mecamylamine, dextromethorphan, bupropion) decreased morphine,
      methamphetamine, and nicotine self-administration in rats at doses that were
      ineffective if administered alone. Together, the data support the hypothesis that
      diencephalic pathways having high densities of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors
      modulate mesocorticolimbic pathways more directly involved in drug reinforcement.
      Antagonists of alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptors may represent a totally novel
      approach to treating multiple addictive disorders, and 18-MC might be the first
      of a new class of synthetic agents acting via this novel mechanism and having a
      broad spectrum of activity.

TI  - Plant derivatives in the treatment of alcohol dependency.
PG  - 593-606
AB  - The present review summarizes the findings of the effects of extracts of purified
      compounds from several plants on alcohol intake in alcohol-preferring rats. These
      include St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum, HPE), kudzu (Pueraria lobata) and 
      ibogaine (Tabernanthe iboga). Alcohol-preferring (P), Marchigian Sardinian (msP),
      high-alcohol-drinking (HAD), Fawn-Hooded (FH) rats were allowed to drink alcohol 
      or water voluntarily to establish baseline levels. Pure compounds (puerarin,
      daidzin, daidzein or analogs) isolated from kudzu, extracts from HPE or ibogaine 
      and its analog were given by either intraperitoneal or oral administration. After
      acute administration, all agents dose-dependently reduced alcohol intake with
      minimal effects on food intake. Puerarin and HPE were also effective following
      chronic treatment. Overall, it is clear that pure compounds (daidzin, puerarin), 
      extracts from St. John's wort, ibogaine and an ibogaine analog suppress alcohol
      intake in animal models of excessive drinking with minimal effects on other
      appetitive behaviors. Although the true mechanisms of action of these compounds
      on alcohol intake are not fully understood, with the current information, it
      appears that these compounds exert their effects by modulating several neuronal
      systems implicated in drinking behavior. However, their role in the future of
      pharmacotherapy for alcoholism will depend upon the outcome of carefully
      conducted clinical trials.

TI  - Affinity and specificity of N-methyl- D-aspartate channel blockers affect their
      ability to disrupt prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle in rats.
PG  - 378-85
AB  - RATIONALE: Phencyclidine (PCP) binds with high affinity to a site located within 
      the ionophore of N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that PCP and other high-affinity NMDA channel blockers reliably
      disrupt prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle, an animal model of
      sensorimotor gating used to study attentional deficits associated with
      schizophrenia. Recently, a number of low-affinity NMDA channel blockers that
      exhibit minimal PCP-like effects in humans at therapeutic doses have been
      developed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects on
      PPI of NMDA channel blockers with varying affinities for the channel site as well
      as different specificities for NMDA receptors. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      presented with multiple stimulus presentation trials, including pulse-alone and
      PPI trials. RESULTS: As expected, the high-affinity ligands dizocilpine and
      dextrorphan disrupted PPI at doses that did not affect the response during
      pulse-alone trials. Low-affinity drugs produced a mixed pattern of results.
      Whereas dextromethorphan and memantine disrupted PPI, orphenadrine, amantadine,
      desipramine, and alaproclate did not affect this response. Ibogaine also
      disrupted PPI, but only within a dose range that severely decreased the startle
      response during pulse-alone trials. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that not
      all NMDA channel blockers share PCP's effect of PPI disruption. In addition, they
      suggest caution in the use of supratherapeutic doses of these compounds and in
      their use in vulnerable populations (e.g., schizophrenic patients).

TI  - Hallucinogens and redemption.
PG  - 239-48
AB  - This article examines drug substitution with regard to hallucinogens (ayahuasca, 
      ibogaine, peyote and LSD) set within the concept of redemption. The model
      examines both religious and secular approaches to the contemporary use of
      hallucinogens in drug substitution, both by scientists and in religious settings 
      worldwide. The redemptive model posits that the proper use of one psychoactive
      substance within a spiritual or clinical context helps to free an individual from
      the adverse effects of their addiction to another substance and thus restores
      them as functioning members of their community or group. Data is drawn from the
      U.S., Brazil, Peru, and West Africa. Two principle mechanisms for this are
      proposed: the psychological mechanism of suggestibility is examined in terms of
      the individual reaching abstinence goals from addictive substances such as
      alcohol and opiates. Neurophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms to
      understand the efficacy of such substitution are highlighted from ongoing
      research on hallucinogens. Research by two of the authors with the Unaio do
      Vegetal (UDV) Church in Brazil is examined in terms of the model.

TI  - A review of chemical agents in the pharmacotherapy of addiction.
PG  - 1807-18
AB  - Chemical substance abuse has tormented mankind throughout history. A number of
      chemical approaches have been employed in an attempt to treat chemical addiction.
      Unfortunately, most of these have proven unsuccessful though several chemical
      entities have been shown to be moderately effective. The naturally occurring
      alkaloid ibogaine has been reported to interrupt the cravings for alcohol,
      cocaine and opiates. Other alkaloids from Tabernanthe iboga, such as ibogamine
      and tabernanthine, provide insight into the structure activity relationship at
      the different receptors believed to be involved in addiction. The synthetic iboga
      alkaloid congener, 18-MC, also shows potential as an anti-addictive agent without
      the hallucinogenic effects of ibogaine. Additionally, acamprosate, BP 897,
      GBR12909, lofexidine and memantine have shown promising results in the treatment 
      of addiction. All of these leads provide a start for the medicinal chemist to
      design anti-addictive agents, since currently no drugs are approved in the U.S.
      for the treatment of addictions to cocaine, methamphetamine, other stimulants or 
      PCP.

TI  - Ibogaine signals addiction genes and methamphetamine alteration of long-term
      potentiation.
PG  - 28-46
AB  - The mapping of the human genetic code will enable us to identify potential gene
      products involved in human addictions and diseases that have hereditary
      components. Thus, large-scale, parallel gene-expression studies, made possible by
      advances in microarray technologies, have shown insights into the connection
      between specific genes, or sets of genes, and human diseases. The compulsive use 
      of addictive substances despite adverse consequences continues to affect society,
      and the science underlying these addictions in general is intensively studied.
      Pharmacological treatment of drug and alcohol addiction has largely been
      disappointing, and new therapeutic targets and hypotheses are needed. As the
      usefulness of the pharmacotherapy of addiction has been limited, an emerging
      potential, yet controversial, therapeutic agent is the natural alkaloid ibogaine.
      We have continued to investigate programs of gene expression and the putative
      signaling molecules used by psychostimulants such as amphetamine in in vivo and
      in vitro models. Our work and that of others reveal that complex but defined
      signal transduction pathways are associated with psychostimulant administration
      and that there is broad-spectrum regulation of these signals by ibogaine. We
      report that the actions of methamphetamine were similar to those of cocaine,
      including the propensity to alter long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus
      of the rat brain. This action suggests that there may be a "threshold" beyond
      which the excessive brain stimulation that probably occurs with compulsive
      psychostimulant use results in the occlusion of LTP. The influence of ibogaine on
      immediate early genes (IEGs) and other candidate genes possibly regulated by
      psychostimulants and other abused substances requires further evaluation in
      compulsive use, reward, relapse, tolerance, craving and withdrawal reactions. It 
      is therefore tempting to suggest that ibogaine signals addiction gene products.

TI  - In vitro activities of iboga alkaloid congeners coronaridine and
      18-methoxycoronaridine against Leishmania amazonensis.
PG  - 2111-5
AB  - In previous studies, we demonstrated the leishmanicide effect of coronaridine, a 
      natural indole alkaloid isolated from stem bark of Peschiera australis (Delorenzi
      et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 45:1349-1354, 2001). In this study we show 
      the leishmanicidal effect of the synthetic coronaridine and its racemic
      18-methoxylated analog, 18-methoxycoronaridine. Both alkaloids revealed a potent 
      leishmanicide effect against Leishmania amazonensis, a causative agent of
      cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World. Despite their
      potent leishmanicide effect, both alkaloids were neither toxic to murine
      macrophages nor did they modulate their oxidative or cytokine production
      responses.

TI  - Sigma receptors inhibit high-voltage-activated calcium channels in rat
      sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.
PG  - 2867-79
AB  - Studies on the expression and cellular function of sigma receptors in autonomic
      neurons were conducted in neonatal rat intracardiac and superior cervical (SCG)
      ganglia. Individual neurons from SCG and intracardiac ganglia were shown to
      express transcripts encoding the sigma-1 receptor using single-cell RT-PCR
      techniques. The relationship between sigma receptors and calcium channels was
      studied in isolated neurons of these ganglia under voltage-clamp mode using the
      perforated-patch configuration of the whole cell patch-clamp recording technique.
      Bath application of sigma receptor agonists was shown to rapidly depress peak
      calcium channel currents in a reversible manner in both SCG and intracardiac
      ganglion neurons. The inhibition of barium (I(Ba)) currents was dose-dependent,
      and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for haloperidol,
      ibogaine, (+)-pentazocine, and 1,3-Di-O-tolylguanidin (DTG) were 6, 31, 61, and
      133 microM, respectively. The rank order potency of haloperidol > ibogaine >
      (+)-pentazocine > DTG is consistent with the effects on calcium channels being
      mediated by a sigma-2 receptor. Preincubation of neurons with the irreversible
      sigma receptor antagonist, metaphit, blocked DTG-mediated inhibition of Ca2+
      channel currents. Maximum inhibition of calcium channel currents was > or =95%,
      suggesting that sigma receptors block all calcium channel subtypes found on the
      cell body of these neurons, which includes N-, L-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium
      channels. In addition to depressing peak Ca2+ channel current, sigma receptors
      altered the biophysical properties of these channels. Following sigma receptor
      activation, Ca2+ channel inactivation rate was accelerated, and the voltage
      dependence of both steady-state inactivation and activation shifted toward more
      negative potentials. Experiments on the signal transduction cascade coupling
      sigma receptors and Ca2+ channels demonstrated that neither cell dialysis nor
      intracellular application of 100 microM guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)
      trilithium salt (GDP-beta-S) abolished the modulation of I(Ba) by sigma receptor 
      agonists. These data suggest that neither a diffusible cytosolic second messenger
      nor a G protein is involved in this pathway. Activation of sigma receptors on
      sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons is likely to modulate cell-to-cell
      signaling in autonomic ganglia and thus the regulation of cardiac function by the
      peripheral nervous system.

TI  - Metabolism of 18-methoxycoronaridine, an ibogaine analog, to
      18-hydroxycoronaridine by genetically variable CYP2C19.
PG  - 663-9
AB  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine, a newly developed ibogaine analog, has been reported to
      decrease the self-administration of morphine, cocaine, ethanol, and nicotine. It 
      has also been reported to attenuate naltrexone-precipitated signs of morphine
      withdrawal. In this study, three metabolites of 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC)
      were separated and identified by high-performance liquid
      chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry
      (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS); the major metabolite was 18-hydroxycoronaridine (18-HC). The
      other two metabolites were elucidated as hydroxylated metabolites on the basis of
      their MS-MS spectra. Catalytic studies of 18-MC O-demethylase activity in human
      liver microsomes indicate that one high affinity enzyme is involved in this
      reaction (K(m) from 2.81 to 7.9 microM; V(max) from 0.045 to 0.29 nmol/mg/min).
      In cDNA-expressing microsomes, only CYP2C19 displayed significant 18-MC
      O-demethylase activity (K(m) 1.34 microM; V(max) 0.21 nmol/mg/min).
      S-Mephenytoin, a selective CYP2C19 inhibitor, inhibited 18-MC O-demethylation by 
      65% at a concentration of 2 times its K(I), and antibodies against rat 2C (human 
      CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19) inhibited 18-HC formation by 70%. Studies with other
      cytochrome P450 (P450)-selective chemical inhibitors and antibodies failed to
      demonstrate an appreciable role for other P450s in this reaction. In addition, in
      microsomes from five different human livers, 18-MC O-demethylation correlated
      with S-mephenytoin 4'hydroxylase activity but not with other P450 probe
      reactions. These data indicate that 18-HC formation is the predominant pathway of
      18-MC metabolism in vitro in human liver microsomes and that this metabolic
      pathway is primarily catalyzed by the polymorphic CYP2C19. The apparent
      selectivity of this pathway for CYP2C19 suggests 18-MC as a potentially useful
      probe of CYP2C19 activity in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Why do Purkinje cells die so easily after global brain ischemia? Aldolase C,
      EAAT4, and the cerebellar contribution to posthypoxic myoclonus.
PG  - 331-59
AB  - The experiments strongly suggested that the reason why Purkinje cells die so
      easily after global brain ischemia relates to deficiencies in aldolase C and
      EAAT4 that allow them to survive pathologically intense synaptic input from the
      inferior olive after the restoration of blood flow. This conclusion is based on: 
      (a) the remarkably tight correspondence between the regional absence of aldolase 
      C and EAAT4 in Purkinje cells and the patterned loss of Purkinje cells after a
      bout of global brain ischemia; (b) the necessity of the olivocerebellar pathway
      for the ischemic death of Purkinje cells; and (c) the build-up of pathologically 
      synchronous and high-frequency burst activity within the inferior olive during
      recovery from ischemia. Indeed, the correspondence between the absence of
      aldolase C and EAAT4 to sensitivity to ischemia could be demonstrated for zones
      of Purkinje cells as small as two neurons. A second finding was that Purkinje
      cells are not uniformly sensitive to transient ischemia, since they die most
      frequently in zones where aldolase C and EAAT4 are absent. One implication of the
      experiment is that factors beyond the unique synaptic and membrane properties of 
      Purkinje cells play an important role in determining this neuron's high
      sensitivity to ischemia. The data strongly imply that two properties of Purkinje 
      cells that make them susceptible to ischemic death are their reduced capability
      to sequester glutamate and reduced ability to generate energy during anoxia. The 
      patterned death of Purkinje cells is sufficient to induce a form of audiogenic
      myoclonus, as determined with a neurotoxic dose of ibogaine. Ibogaine-induced
      myoclonus is recognized behaviorally as a reduced ability to habituate to a
      startle stimulus and resembles the myoclonic jerk of rats during recovery from a 
      prolonged bout of global brain ischemia. Commonalities of ischemia and
      ibogaine-induced neurodegeneration are the intricately striped Purkinje cell loss
      in the posterior lobe and a nearly complete deafferentation of the lateral aspect
      of the fastigial nucleus from the cerebellar cortex, in particular the
      dorsolateral protuberance. Thus, the data point strongly to a cerebellar
      contribution to audiogenic myoclonus. Single-neuron electrophysiology experiments
      in monkeys have demonstrated that the evoked activity in the deep cerebellar
      nuclei occurs too late to initiate the startle response (60) and electromyography
      of the postischemic myoclonus of rats corroborates this view (see Chapter 31)
      (20). However, the nearly complete loss of GABAergic terminals in the
      dorsolateral protuberance after Purkinje cell death would be expected to
      dramatically increase its tonic firing and the background excitation of the
      brain-stem structures that it innervates. The fastigial nucleus innervates a
      large number of autonomic and motor structures in the brainstem and diencephalon,
      including the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus and the gigantocellular
      reticular nucleus in the medulla--structures that have been implicated in human
      posthypoxic myoclonus (6, 7). We propose that the posthypoxic myoclonic jerk of
      rats is, at least in part, due to disinhibition of the fastigial nucleus produced
      by patterned Purkinje cell death in the vermis. The argument is as follows: the
      loss of GABAergic inhibition in the fastigial nucleus after ischemia leads to
      diaschisis of the motor thalamus and reticular formation which, in turn, is
      responsible for enhanced motor excitability and myoclonus. That the audiogenic
      myoclonus after global brain ischemia in the rat gradually resolves over a period
      of 2 to 3 weeks is consistent with this view, as restoration of background
      excitability after CNS damage in rats has been documented to occur within this
      time-frame (61). Our view brings together the physiologic finding that
      posthypoxic myoclonus appears to originate in the sensory-motor cortices and/or
      reticular formation with the consistent anatomical finding of Purkinje cell loss 
      after ischemia, and explains the puzzle of Marsden's unique cases of myoclonus
      associated with coeliac disease (1). Moreover, our argument is consistent with
      findings both in rats (62, 63) and humans (64) that damage to the vermis impairs 
      the long-term habituation of the startle reflex. It remains to be determined
      whether the pathologically enhanced startle responses after vermal damage
      resemble brain-stem reticular or cortical myoclonus at the electrophysiologic
      level of analysis. What is the purpose of the regional expression of aldolase C
      and EAAT4 in Purkinje cells? The close correspondence between the spatial
      distribution of aldolase C and the parasagittal anatomy of the cerebellum (48)
      has led to the view that aldolase C may help specify connectivity during
      development. While the present experiments do not address this issue, they
      underscore the fact that aldolase plays a fundamental role in metabolism. Because
      Purkinje cells have a repressed expression of aldolase A (31), whatever role the 
      absence of aldolase C may play during development comes at the price of metabolic
      frailty later in adulthood. From another point of view, aldolase C and EAAT4
      appear to confer upon Purkinje cells the ability to survive their own climbing
      fiber. Indeed, climbing fibers form a distributed synapse that synchronously
      releases glutamate (or aspartate) at all levels of the dendritic tree
      simultaneously (65, 66). Such synchronous activation triggers calcium influx
      throughout the Purkinje cell dendrites at a magnitude that is unparalleled in the
      nervous system (12), and, thus, places an extraordinarily high metabolic demand
      on the Purkinje cell. The apparently reduced level of aldolase in a subpopulation
      of Purkinje cells provides the condition for energy failure and death during
      anoxia so long as the climbing fibers are intact or when climbing fiber
      activation is pharmacologically enhanced under normoxic conditions, such as after
      ibogaine (53-56). Lastly, the argument that diaschisis produced by patterned
      cerebellar degeneration leads to thalamo-cortical and reticular hyperexcitability
      agrees with C. David Marsden and his colleagues' bold demonstration of an
      inhibitory influence of cerebellar cortex on motor cortex in humans (67). Our
      anatomic data indicate that the spatially distinct zones of Purkinje cells, which
      are killed by global brain ischemia, may be the origin of such inhibition.

TI  - Extraction studies of Tabernanthe iboga and Voacanga africana.
PG  - 71-6
AB  - The root bark of Tabernanthe iboga contains ibogaine as its predominant alkaloid 
      and has been an important source of it. Ibogaine is used experimentally to
      interrupt drug addiction and allow therapeutic intervention, but is currently
      unaffordable to doctors in less economically developed countries. To meet this
      need, an extraction of alkaloids from T. iboga root bark was optimized and
      simplified to use only diluted vinegar and ammonia, and was successfully applied 
      to related alkaloids from Voacanga africana bark also. The alkaloids were
      converted to their hydrochlorides and purified, and the minor alkaloids were
      recovered.

TI  - Antagonism of alpha 3 beta 4 nicotinic receptors as a strategy to reduce opioid
      and stimulant self-administration.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - The iboga alkaloid ibogaine and the novel iboga alkaloid congener
      18-methoxycoronaridine are putative anti-addictive agents. Using patch-clamp
      methodology, the actions of ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine at various
      neurotransmitter receptor ion-channel subtypes were determined. Both ibogaine and
      18-methoxycoronaridine were antagonists at alpha 3 beta 4 nicotinic receptors and
      both agents were more potent at this site than at alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic
      receptors or at NMDA or 5-HT(3) receptors; 18-methoxycoronaridine was more
      selective in this regard than ibogaine. In studies of morphine and
      methamphetamine self-administration, the effects of low dose combinations of
      18-methoxycoronaridine with mecamylamine or dextromethorphan and of mecamylamine 
      with dextromethorphan were assessed. Mecamylamine and dextromethorphan have also 
      been shown to be antagonists at alpha 3 beta 4 nicotinic receptors. All three
      drug combinations decreased both morphine and methamphetamine self-administration
      at doses that were ineffective if administered alone. The data are consistent
      with the hypothesis that antagonism at alpha 3 beta 4 receptors is a potential
      mechanism to modulate drug seeking behavior. 18-Methoxycoronaridine apparently
      has greater selectivity for this site than other agents and may be the first of a
      new class of synthetic agents acting via this novel mechanism to produce a broad 
      spectrum of anti-addictive activity.

TI  - Characterization of the discriminable stimulus produced by 2-BFI: effects of
      imidazoline I(2)-site ligands, MAOIs, beta-carbolines, agmatine and ibogaine.
PG  - 1227-34
AB  - 1. The molecular nature and functions of the I(2) subtype of imidazoline binding 
      sites are unknown but evidence suggests an association with monoamine oxidase
      (MAO). Rats can distinguish the selective imidazoline I(2)-site ligand 2-BFI from
      vehicle in drug discrimination, indicating functional consequences of occupation 
      of these sites. We have used drug discrimination to investigate the nature of the
      discriminable stimulus, especially in relation to MAO inhibition. 2. Following
      training to distinguish 2-BFI 7 mg kg(-1) i.p. from saline vehicle in two-lever
      operant-chambers, male Hooded Lister rats underwent sessions where test
      substances were given instead and the proportion of lever presses on the
      2-BFI-associated lever (substitution) recorded. 3. 2-BFI; its cogeners BU216,
      BU224, BU226 and LSL60101; the reversible MAO-A inhibitors moclobemide and
      RO41-1049; the beta-carbolines harmane, norharmane and harmaline which also
      reversibly inhibit MAO-A, and the anti-addictive substance ibogaine exhibited
      potent, dose-dependent substitution for 2-BFI. 4. Agmatine, and LSL60125
      substituted at one dose only. The reversible MAO-B inhibitors lazabemide and
      RO16-1649; the sigma(2)-site ligand SKF10,047 and the I(2A)-site ligand,
      amiloride, failed to substitute. The irreversible inhibitor of MAO, deprenyl,
      substituted for 2-BFI while clorgyline did not. 5. These results suggest
      imidazoline I(2) site ligands produce a common discriminable stimulus that
      appears associated with reversible inhibition of MAO-A rather than MAO-B,
      possibly through increases in extracellular concentration of one or more
      monoamines. Ibogaine exhibits a commonality in its subjective effects with those 
      of I(2)-site ligands.

TI  - Liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric determination of biologically active
      alkaloids in extracts of Peschiera fuschiaefolia.
PG  - 216-22
AB  - Four alkaloids were isolated from an alcoholic extract of the bark from the stem 
      of Peschiera fuschiaefolia. Two of these compounds, voacamine and voacamidine,
      are dimeric alkaloids which are thought to be responsible for the antimalarial
      activity of these extracts. The mass spectra and the response factors of these
      four compounds were obtained by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in the
      electrospray positive ionization mode. The concentrations of these alkaloids were
      measured in two different P. fuschiaefolia extracts. The ion chromatograms of the
      two extracts were compared on the basis of their [M + H](+) and [M + 2H](+2) ions
      characteristic of various alkaloids previously isolated from P. fuschiaefolia
      bark. The two extracts were found to differ mostly in the relative concentrations
      of the dimeric alkaloids.

TI  - Ibogaine interferes with motivational and somatic effects of
      naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from acutely administered morphine.
PG  - 293-7
AB  - It has been reported that ibogaine interferes with somatic withdrawal reactions
      in rats chronically treated with morphine. The present experiments demonstrated
      that ibogaine also interferes with motivational withdrawal reactions and somatic 
      withdrawal reactions in rats treated with morphine on only two occasions. On each
      of two conditioning trials, naloxone was administered 24 h following an injection
      of morphine. Four hours prior to each naloxone administration, rats were injected
      with either ibogaine or saline. In two experiments, ibogaine interfered with
      naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. In Experiment 1, ibogaine-treated rats
      displayed a weaker aversion to the withdrawal-paired chamber, and in Experiment
      2, ibogaine-treated rats displayed fewer somatic withdrawal reactions than did
      saline treated rats.

TI  - Drug discrimination studies with ibogaine.
PG  - 63-77
AB  - The results of the studies described here support the hypothesis that ibogaine
      produces its effects via selective interactions with multiple receptors. It
      appears that 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and sigma 2 receptors are involved in mediating the 
      stimulus effects of ibogaine. In addition, opiate receptors may also be involved.
      In contrast, sigma 1, PCP/MK-801, 5-HT3, and 5-HT1A receptors do not appear to
      play a major role. Ibogaine's hallucinogenic effects may be explained by its
      interactions with 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while its putative antiaddictive
      properties may result from its interactions with sigma 2 and opiate receptors.
      Alternatively, the possibility that ibogaine's hallucinogenic properties underlie
      its antiaddictive effects, as previously suggested (34), would support a role for
      5-HT2 receptors in mediating the reported therapeutic effects of ibogaine.
      Certainly many questions remain regarding ibogaine's mechanism of action.
      Although drug discrimination will be useful for answering some of those
      questions, the true potential of this technique is realized whin it is combined
      with other techniques. The next few years promise to be fruitful with respect to 
      our understanding of this agent. Reasons supporting this belief include advances 
      in the study of sigma receptors, interest in ibogaine's effects on second
      messenger systems, and the development of ibogaine congeners such as
      18-methoxycoronaridine (35). In conclusion, the aforementioned studies should
      serve to guide further endeavors. Pertinent questions have been generated: What
      is the role of sigma receptors in the effects of ibogaine, especially with regard
      to addiction? How does ibogaine affect opiate neurotransmission? What effects, if
      any, do the Harmala alkaloids have on addiction phenomena? What is the mechanism 
      of action of harmaline? Can 10-hydroxyibogamine serve as a discriminative
      stimulus and, if so, what receptor interactions mediate its stimulus effects?
      Does the ibogaine-trained stimulus generalize to novel agents, including
      18-methoxycoronaridine?

TI  - Fluoro-Jade and silver methods: application to the neuropathology of scrapie, a
      transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.
PG  - 104-12
AB  - Traditional methods for evaluating neurodegeneration include variations of
      Nauta's selective silver-staining techniques. The Fluoro-Jade (FJ) method applies
      a novel fluorescent, anionic stain for localizing degenerating neurons. FJ has
      produced comparable results to the silver methods, when both have been applied to
      detect neurodegeneration in animals treated acutely with a variety of
      neurotoxins, including kainic acid (KA), ibogaine (IBO), 3-nitropropionic acid
      (3-NPA), domoic acid and others. The potential value of methods selective for
      neurodegeneration in elucidating the pathophysiology of transmissible spongiform 
      encephalopathies (TSEs), such as the prion disease 'scrapie', has not yet been
      investigated. Using frozen or paraffin sections stained with FJ or silver, we
      evaluated the brains of hamsters inoculated with either the 263K or the 139H
      strains of scrapie, originally passaged from sheep into mice and then into
      hamsters. As a positive control, we also examined sections from IBO-treated rats,
      which experience degeneration restricted to small clusters of Purkinje neurons
      located in the paravermal region of the cerebellum. As expected, both FJ and
      silver methods delineated this identical pattern of neurodegeneration,
      characteristic of IBO exposure. Surprisingly, only a small number of FJ or
      silver-labeled cortical neurons were observed in scrapie-infected hamsters
      evaluated near the end of their incubation period but before obvious spongiform
      pathology. Instead, there was intense fluorescent staining of astrocytes in
      scrapie-infected hamsters, especially in the cortex, corpus callosum, and
      hypothalamus. Detailed protocols describing the application of the
      degeneration-selective methods we utilized are presented and compared.

TI  - Iboga compounds reverse the behavioural disinhibiting and corticosterone effects 
      of acute methamphetamine: Implications for their antiaddictive properties.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - This study investigated the effects of pretreatment with the putative
      antiaddictive compound, ibogaine (IBO), and its synthetic derivative,
      18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), on the changes in behaviour in an elevated plus
      maze and the changes in corticosterone (CORT) produced by a low dose of
      methamphetamine (METH). In the elevated plus maze, the acute administration of
      METH (0.1 mg/kg ip, -20 min) produced an increase in both the number and the
      duration of open arm entries relative to saline (SAL)-treated controls. No effect
      of METH administration was observed on the total number of arm entries. These
      data indicated that METH alone produced either anxiolysis or behavioural
      disinhibition in this paradigm. More consistent with the latter possibility, the 
      open arm behaviour of METH controls was associated with an increase in plasma
      levels of CORT, supporting a facilitatory role for CORT in this METH-induced
      effect. Pretreatment with both IBO and 18-MC (40 mg/kg ip, 19 h earlier)
      antagonized the behavioural disinhibiting effects of acute METH without altering 
      locomotor activity. In addition, both iboga agents antagonized the increase in
      CORT produced by METH. These data provide insight into yet another potential
      mechanism through which iboga compounds may exert their antiaddictive effects, a 
      reversal of the behavioural disinhibiting properties of stimulant drugs.
      Furthermore, these data indicate that this reversal is related to effects of
      iboga compounds on the stimulation of neuroendocrine systems by stimulant drugs.

TI  - Evaluation of neurodegeneration in scrapie-infected animals by selective methods 
      that detect cellular degeneration.
PG  - 175-8
AB  - Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats. The precise
      details of neuronal and neurite degeneration in scrapie-infected animals remain
      unknown. Using specific silver staining methods, we compared the
      neurodegeneration caused by treatment of rats with kainic acid (KA) or ibogaine
      (IBO) to the neuropathology observed in mice infected with the C602 strain of
      scrapie. As reported previously, KA resulted in extensive silver labeling of
      neurons, especially in the cortex, putamen and hippocampus. IBO silver labeling
      was observed only in small clusters of Purkinje neurons in the paravermal region 
      of the cerebellum. However, in scrapie-infected mice, a few silver stained
      neurons (differing from the dark degenerating neurons observed following
      neurotoxic exposure) were found in layer II of cortex, cingulate cortex, zona
      incerta, thalamus and hypothalamus. Some silver grains were observed in
      glial-like cells, especially those in the paraventricular region. Degenerating
      axons were positive for silver staining and were found in the cortex, cingulate
      cortex, corpus callosum, habenulae, septum, fornix, thalamus, caudate putamen and
      a few in fasciculus retroflexus and substantia nigra. Our results suggest that
      the limbic system is one of the important loci for the neurodegenerative effect
      of at least some scrapie strains.

TI  - In vivo neurobiological effects of ibogaine and its O-desmethyl metabolite,
      12-hydroxyibogamine (noribogaine), in rats.
PG  - 531-9
AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring compound with purported antiaddictive
      properties. When administered to primates, ibogaine is rapidly o-demethylated to 
      form the metabolite 12-hydroxyibogamine (noribogaine). Peak blood levels of
      noribogaine exceed those of ibogaine, and noribogaine persists in the bloodstream
      for at least 1 day. Very few studies have systematically evaluated the
      neurobiological effects of noribogaine in vivo. In the present series of
      experiments, we compared the effects of i.v. administration of ibogaine and
      noribogaine (1 and 10 mg/kg) on motor behaviors, stress hormones, and
      extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus
      accumbens of male rats. Ibogaine caused dose-related increases in tremors,
      whereas noribogaine did not. Both ibogaine and noribogaine produced significant
      elevations in plasma corticosterone and prolactin, but ibogaine was a more potent
      stimulator of corticosterone secretion. Neither drug altered extracellular DA
      levels in the nucleus accumbens. However, both drugs increased extracellular 5-HT
      levels, and noribogaine was more potent in this respect. Results from in vitro
      experiments indicated that ibogaine and noribogaine interact with 5-HT
      transporters to inhibit 5-HT uptake. The present findings demonstrate that
      noribogaine is biologically active and undoubtedly contributes to the in vivo
      pharmacological profile of ibogaine in rats. Noribogaine is approximately 10
      times more potent than ibogaine as an indirect 5-HT agonist. More importantly,
      noribogaine appears less apt to produce the adverse effects associated with
      ibogaine, indicating the metabolite may be a safer alternative for medication
      development.

TI  - Antileishmanial activity of an indole alkaloid from Peschiera australis.
PG  - 1349-54
AB  - In this study, we show the leishmanicidal effects of a chloroform fraction (CLF) 
      and a purified indole alkaloid obtained from crude stem extract of Peschiera
      australis against Leishmania amazonensis, a causative agent of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis in the New World. In a bioassay-guided chemical fractionation, the 
      leishmanicidal activity in CLF completely and irreversibly inhibited promastigote
      growth. This fraction was also active against amastigotes in infected murine
      macrophages. Chemical analysis of CLF identified an iboga-type indole alkaloid
      coronaridine as one of its major compounds. Coronaridine showed potent
      antileishmanial activity, inhibiting promastigote and amastigote growth.
      Promastigotes and amastigotes treated with CLF or coronaridine showed pronounced 
      alterations in their mitochondria as assessed by transmission electron
      microscopy.

TI  - Ibogaine alters synaptosomal and glial glutamate release and uptake.
PG  - 263-7
AB  - Ibogaine has aroused expectations as a potentially innovative medication for drug
      addiction. It has been proposed that antagonism of the NMDA receptor by ibogaine 
      may be one of the mechanisms underlying its antiaddictive properties; glutamate
      has also been implicated in ibogaine-induced neurotoxicity. We here report the
      effects of ibogaine on [3H]glutamate release and uptake in cortical and
      cerebellar synaptosomes, as well as in cortical astrocyte cultures, from mice and
      rats. Ibogaine (2-1000 microM) had no effects on glutamate uptake or release by
      rat synaptosomes. However, ibogaine (500-1000 microM) significantly inhibited the
      glutamate uptake and stimulated the release of glutamate by cortical (but not
      cerebellar) synaptosomes of mice. In addition, ibogaine (1000 microM) nearly
      abolished glutamate uptake by cortical astrocyte cultures from rats and mice. The
      data provide direct evidence of glutamate involvement in ibogaine-induced
      neurotoxicity.

TI  - Biological activities of the plant-derived bisindole voacamine with reference to 
      malaria.
PG  - 30-3
AB  - The in vivo antiplasmodial activity of voacamine was assessed in a 4-day test. It
      was shown to exhibit in vivo activity with 25.4% and 43.4% inhibition of
      parasitaemia with 2.5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. In synchronized cultures, it
      was found to act on trophozoite and schizont stages of Plasmodium falciparum.
      Using the FMC29 strain of Plasmodium falciparum as parasite and the isobologram
      curve as a method to assess interaction in drug combination, it was shown to lack
      any chloroquine-enhancing activity and its in vitro antiplasmodial effect was not
      potentiated by the chemosensitizer malagashanine.

TI  - Differential neuronal localizations and dynamics of phosphorylated and
      unphosphorylated type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.
PG  - 433-44
AB  - Type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are phosphorylated by
      cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase A at serines 1589 and 1755, with serine 1755 
      phosphorylation greatly predominating in the brain. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
      receptor protein kinase A phosphorylation augments Ca(2+) release. To assess type
      1 protein kinase A phosphorylation dynamics in the intact organism, we developed 
      antibodies selective for either serine 1755 phosphorylated or unphosphorylated
      species. Immunohistochemical studies reveal marked variation in localization. For
      example, in the hippocampus the phosphorylated type 1 inositol
      1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is restricted to CA1, while the unphosphorylated
      receptor occurs ubiquitously in CA1-CA3 and dentate gyrus granule cells.
      Throughout the brain the phosphorylated type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
      receptor is selectively enriched in dendrites, while the unphosphorylated
      receptor predominates in cell bodies. Focal cerebral ischemia in rats and humans 
      is associated with dephosphorylation of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
      receptors, and glutamatergic excitation of cerebellar Purkinje cells mediated by 
      ibogaine elicits dephosphorylation of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
      receptors that precedes evidence of excitotoxic neuronal degeneration. We have
      demonstrated striking variations in regional and subcellular distribution of
      inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor phosphorylation that may influence normal
      physiological intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in rat and human brain. We have
      further shown that the subcellular distribution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
      receptor phosphorylation in neurons is regulated by excitatory neurotransmission,
      as well as excitotoxic insult and neuronal ischemia-reperfusion. Phosphorylation 
      dynamics of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors may modulate
      intracellular Ca(2+) release and influence the cellular response to neurotoxic
      insults.

TI  - The development and expression of locomotor sensitization to nicotine in the
      presence of ibogaine.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive alkaloid with claimed efficacy in 
      the treatment of certain drug addictions, including nicotine. It has been
      reported to be a non-competitive blocker of nicotinic receptors, with a potent
      inhibitory action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated catecholamine
      release. We have investigated the effect of different doses of ibogaine on the
      development and expression of sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effect of 
      nicotine in rats, a facilitatory process in which a history of exposure to
      nicotine results in enhanced locomotor activity when the same dose of nicotine is
      administered repeatedly. The effects were determined of co-administering ibogaine
      (0.0, 5.0 or 10 mg/kg i.p.) with nicotine (0.0 or 0.4 mg/kg s.c.) daily for 21
      days. Dose-response curves for nicotine (0.04-0.8 mg/kg s.c.) were then
      determined in groups of 10 rats. There was clear sensitization of the locomotor
      activity produced by nicotine in photocell activity cages but co-administration
      of ibogaine with nicotine had no effect on the degree of sensitization. Ibogaine 
      (5-20 mg/kg) itself did not influence locomotor activity and was also without
      effect on the expression of the sensitized response to 0.4 mg/kg of nicotine (n =
      10). Thus, there was no evidence that ibogaine may retard or suppress
      sensitization to nicotine.

TI  - Ibogaine: complex pharmacokinetics, concerns for safety, and preliminary efficacy
      measures.
PG  - 394-401
AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid found in the roots of Tabernanthe Iboga
      (Apocynaceae family), a rain forest shrub that is native to western Africa.
      Ibogaine is used by indigenous peoples in low doses to combat fatigue, hunger and
      thirst, and in higher doses as a sacrament in religious rituals. Members of
      American and European addict self-help groups have claimed that ibogaine promotes
      long-term drug abstinence from addictive substances, including psychostimulants
      and opiates. Anecdotal reports attest that a single dose of ibogaine eliminates
      opiate withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug craving for extended periods of time.
      The purported efficacy of ibogaine for the treatment of drug dependence may be
      due in part to an active metabolite. The majority of ibogaine biotransformation
      proceeds via CYP2D6, including the O-demethylation of ibogaine to
      12-hydroxyibogamine (noribogaine). Blood concentration-time effect profiles of
      ibogaine and noribogaine obtained for individual subjects after single oral dose 
      administrations demonstrate complex pharmacokinetic profiles. Ibogaine has shown 
      preliminary efficacy for opiate detoxification and for short-term stabilization
      of drug-dependent persons as they prepare to enter substance abuse treatment. We 
      report here that ibogaine significantly decreased craving for cocaine and heroin 
      during inpatient detoxification. Self-reports of depressive symptoms were also
      significantly lower after ibogaine treatment and at 30 days after program
      discharge. Because ibogaine is cleared rapidly from the blood, the beneficial
      aftereffects of the drug on craving and depressed mood may be related to the
      effects of noribogaine on the central nervous system.

PG  - 387-93
AB  - The psychoactive indole alkaloid, ibogaine (IBO), has been investigated for over 
      a decade concerning its reported anti-addictive properties for opioids as well as
      psychomotor stimulants. The mechanism for the anti-addictive action of IBO is
      still unclear. IBO interactions with opioid, NMDA, nicotinic, adrenergic, and
      serotonergic receptor sites have been suggested. The involvement of the
      dopaminergic system in IBO action is well documented. Increased or decreased
      levels of dopamine (DA) in specific brain regions following IBO pretreatment have
      been seen concomitantly with increased or decreased motor activity after
      subsequent amphetamine or cocaine administration. In this report, in vivo
      electrophysiological measures were monitored in awake adult male rats in order to
      investigate alterations of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) resulting from
      interactions between IBO and cocaine (COC). Rats were implanted bilaterally with 
      bipolar ECoG electrodes. They were either injected with saline, COC alone (20
      mg/kg, i.p.) or IBO (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and COC 1 hr later. The concentrations of
      DA, 5-HT, and their metabolites DOPAC, HVA, and 5-HIAA were assessed in the
      caudate nucleus in separate groups of saline-, COC-, and IBO/COC-treated rats. An
      alpha1 power increase was observed within 10 min after COC injection, which
      lasted for less than 20 min. A desynchronization over alpha2 and both beta power 
      bands was observed throughout the recording. In IBO/COC-treated rats, a
      significant increase in delta, theta, and alpha1 power occurred within 20 min
      after COC injection (p <0.05). This effect lasted for up to an hour. DA levels
      significantly increased after COC only and decreased after IBO administration. A 
      further decrease in levels of DA was observed in IBO/COC-treated rats. DA
      turnover increased significantly after IBO alone but was not observed after
      IBO/COC treatment. The alterations in ECoG and neurotransmitter levels suggest a 
      decreased response to COC following IBO pretreatment.

      efficacy, toxicity, and mechanisms of action.
PG  - 369-86
AB  - 18-MC, a novel iboga alkaloid congener, is being developed as a potential
      treatment for multiple forms of drug abuse. Like ibogaine (40 mg/kg), 18-MC (40
      mg/kg) decreases the intravenous self-administration of morphine and cocaine and 
      the oral self-administration of ethanol and nicotine in rats; unlike ibogaine,
      18-MC does not affect responding for a nondrug reinforcer (water). Both ibogaine 
      and 18-MC ameliorate opioid withdrawal signs. Both ibogaine and 18-MC decrease
      extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, but only ibogaine
      increases extracellular levels of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens. Both
      ibogaine and 18-MC block morphine-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release
      in the nucleus accumbens; only ibogaine enhances cocaine-induced increases in
      accumbal dopamine. Both ibogaine and 18-MC enhance the locomotor and/or
      stereotypic effects of stimulants. Ibogaine attenuates, but 18-MC potentiates,
      the acute locomotor effects of morphine; both compounds attenuate
      morphine-induced locomotion in morphine-experienced rats. Ibogaine produces whole
      body tremors and, at high doses (> or = 100 mg/kg), cerebellar damage; 18-MC does
      not produce these effects. Ibogaine, but not 18-MC, decreases heart rate at high 
      doses. While 18-MC and ibogaine have similar affinities for kappa opioid and
      possibly nicotinic receptors, 18-MC has much lower affinities than ibogaine for
      NMDA and sigma-2 receptors, sodium channels, and the 5-HT transporter. Both 18-MC
      and ibogaine are sequestered in fat and, like ibogaine, 18-MC probably has an
      active metabolite. The data suggest that 18-MC has a narrower spectrum of actions
      and will have a substantially greater therapeutic index than ibogaine.

TI  - Noribogaine (12-hydroxyibogamine): a biologically active metabolite of the
      antiaddictive drug ibogaine.
PG  - 354-68
AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is a plant-derived alkaloid that is being evaluated as a possible 
      medication for substance use disorders. When administered peripherally to monkeys
      and humans, IBO is rapidly converted to an o-demethylated metabolite,
      12-hydroxyibogamine (NORIBO). We have found in rats that peak blood levels of
      NORIBO can exceed those of the parent compound, and NORIBO persists in the
      bloodstream for at least 24 h. Surprisingly few studies have examined the in vivo
      biological activity of NORIBO. In the present series of experiments, we compared 
      the effects of intravenous (i.v.) administration of IBO and NORIBO (1 and 10
      mg/kg) on unconditioned behaviors, circulating stress hormones, and extracellular
      levels of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus accumbens of male
      rats. IBO caused dose-related increases in tremors and forepaw treading, whereas 
      NORIBO did not. Both IBO and NORIBO produced significant elevations in plasma
      corticosterone and prolactin, but IBO was more potent as a stimulator of
      corticosterone secretion. Neither drug affected extracellular DA levels in the
      nucleus accumbens. However, both IBO and NORIBO increased extracellular 5-HT
      levels, and NORIBO was more potent in this regard. The present data demonstrate
      that NORIBO is biologically active and undoubtedly contributes to the in vivo
      pharmacological profile of IBO in rats. Most importantly, NORIBO appears less
      likely to produce the adverse effects associated with IBO (i.e., tremors and
      stress-axis activation), suggesting that the metabolite may be a safer
      alternative for medication development.

TI  - Long-lasting ibogaine protection against NMDA-induced convulsions in mice.
PG  - 1083-7
AB  - Ibogaine, a putative antiaddictive drug, is remarkable in its apparent ability to
      downgrade withdrawal symptoms and drug craving for extended periods of time after
      a single dose. Ibogaine acts as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, while
      NMDA has been implicated in long lasting changes in neuronal function and in the 
      physiological basis of drug addiction. The purpose of this study was to verify if
      persistent changes in NMDA receptors could be shown in vivo and in vitro after a 
      single administration of ibogaine. The time course of ibogaine effects were
      examined on NMDA-induced seizures and [3H] MK-801 binding to cortical membranes
      in mice 30 min, 24, 48, and 72 h post treatment. Ibogaine (80 mg/kg, ip) was
      effective in inhibiting convulsions induced by NMDA at 24 and 72 hours post
      administration. Likewise, [3H] MK-801 binding was significantly decreased at 24
      and 72 h post ibogaine. No significant differences from controls were found at 30
      min or 48 h post ibogaine. This long lasting and complex pattern of modulation of
      NMDA receptors prompted by a single dose of ibogaine may be associated to its
      antiaddictive properties.

TI  - Interactions between iboga agents and methamphetamine sensitization: studies of
      locomotion and stereotypy in rats.
PG  - 234-41
AB  - RATIONALE: The phenomenon of sensitization has been theoretically implicated in
      mediating various aspects of drug addiction. Recent dose-response studies
      demonstrated that pretreatment with the putative antiaddictive agent, ibogaine
      (IBO), and a synthetic iboga alkaloid congener, 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC),
      increase the potency of cocaine to elicit behavioral sensitization, an effect
      proposed to contribute, in part, to their ability to attenuate drug
      self-administration. OBJECTIVES: As abuse of the methylated amphetamine
      derivative, methamphetamine (METH), is a growing public health concern, the
      present study determined the interactions between IBO and 18-MC and the
      expression of METH-induced behavioral sensitization. METHODS: The effects of
      pretreatment with 18-MC (40 mg/kg, IP, 19 h earlier) on the expression of
      METH-induced locomotion (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg, IP) and the effects of
      pretreatment with either IBO or 18-MC on the expression of METH-induced
      stereotypy (2 and 4 mg/kg, IP) were assessed in rats treated chronically with
      either METH (4 mg/kg daily for 7 days) or saline. RESULTS: Compared to
      vehicle-pretreated controls, 18-MC produced an overall enhancement in
      METH-induced locomotion in rats treated chronically, but not acutely, with METH. 
      In addition, both iboga agents increased the stereotypic response to METH.
      CONCLUSIONS: Iboga agents augment both the locomotor and stereotypic effects of
      METH in a manner consistent with previous reports for cocaine. Thus, it appears
      that iboga agents interact in a similar manner with the neural mechanisms
      mediating motor hyperactivity induced by the chronic administration of stimulant 
      drugs.

TI  - A dose-response study of ibogaine-induced neuropathology in the rat cerebellum.
PG  - 95-101
AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is an indole alkaloid from the West African shrub, Tabernanthe
      iboga. It is structurally related to harmaline, and both these compounds are
      rigid analogs of melatonin. IBO has both psychoactive and stimulant properties.
      In single-blind trials with humans, it ameliorated withdrawal symptoms and
      interrupted the addiction process. However, IBO also produced neurodegeneration
      of Purkinje cells and gliosis of Bergmann astrocytes in the cerebella of rats
      given even a single dose (100 mg/kg, ip). Here, we treated rats (n = 6 per group)
      with either a single ip injection of saline or with 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg,
      or 100 mg/kg of IBO. As biomarkers of cerebellar neurotoxicity, we specifically
      labeled degenerating neurons and axons with silver, astrocytes with antisera to
      glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Purkinje neurons with antisera to
      calbindin. All rats of the 100-mg/kg group showed the same pattern of cerebellar 
      damage previously described: multiple bands of degenerating Purkinje neurons. All
      rats of the 75-mg/ kg group had neurodegeneration similar to the 100-mg/kg group,
      but the bands appeared to be narrower. Only 2 of 6 rats that received 50 mg/kg
      were affected; despite few degenerating neuronal perikarya, cerebella from these 
      rats did contain patches of astrocytosis similar to those observed with 75 or 100
      mg/kg IBO. These observations affirm the usefulness of GFAP immunohistochemistry 
      as a sensitive biomarker of neurotoxicity. None of the sections from the 25-mg/kg
      rats, however stained, were distinguishable from saline controls, indicating that
      this dose level may be considered as a no-observable-adverse-effect level
      (NOAEL).

TI  - Iboga interactions with psychomotor stimulants: panacea in the paradox?
PG  - 75-86
AB  - Currently, no effective therapy has been approved for the treatment of addiction 
      to stimulant drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamine and its methylated derivatives).
      However, preclinical studies indicate that the naturally-occurring indole
      alkaloid, ibogaine, and a synthetic iboga alkaloid congener,
      18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), attenuate stimulant self-administration in
      laboratory animals. The in vivo pharmacological interactions between iboga agents
      and stimulant drugs are unclear. Ibogaine enhances the increase in accumbal
      dopamine produced by the acute administration of stimulant drugs. Consistent with
      these data, both ibogaine and 18-MC potentiate the expression of
      stimulant-induced motor behaviors in acute and chronic stimulant-treated animals.
      To account for the paradox between their effects on self-administration and motor
      behavior, we proposed that iboga agents interfere with stimulant
      self-administration by increasing sensitivity to their psychomotor-activating
      effects. However, this interpretation is contradicted by very recent observations
      that 18-MC is without effect on the dopamine response to acute cocaine and that
      both ibogaine and 18-MC block the expression of sensitized levels of dopamine in 
      the nucleus accumbens produced by chronic cocaine administration. Thus, a
      positive relationship exists between the effects of iboga pretreatment on
      stimulant-induced dopamine sensitization and stimulant self-administration
      behavior. These data indicate that iboga agents might attenuate stimulant
      self-administration by reversing the neuroadaptations theoretically implicated in
      drug craving and compulsive drug-seeking behavior.

TI  - Development of novel medications for drug addiction. The legacy of an African
      shrub.
PG  - 88-103
AB  - Ibogaine, one of several alkaloids found in the root bark of the African shrub
      Tabernanthe iboga, has been claimed to be effective in treating multiple forms of
      drug abuse. Problems associated with side effects of ibogaine have spawned a
      search for more effective and safer structural derivatives.
      18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a novel iboga alkaloid congener, appears to have 
      substantial potential for broad use as an anti-addictive therapy. Like ibogaine
      (40 mg/kg), 18-MC (40 mg/kg) decreases the intravenous self-administration of
      morphine and cocaine and the oral self-administration of ethanol and nicotine in 
      rats; unlike ibogaine, 18-MC does not affect responding for a non-drug reinforcer
      (water). Ibogaine and 18-MC appear to reduce the reinforcing efficacies, rather
      than the potencies, of drugs of abuse. Both ibogaine and 18-MC decreases
      extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens while only ibogaine
      increases serotonin levels in this brain region. Both ibogaine and 18-MC block
      morphine-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release in the accumbens; only
      ibogaine enhances cocaine-induced increases in dopamine levels. Ibogaine produces
      whole body tremors and, at high doses (at least 100 mg/kg), cerebellar damage;
      18-MC does not produce these effects. Ibogaine, but not 18-MC, causes bradycardia
      at high doses. Ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine have low microM affinities
      for kappa and mu opioid receptors, NMDA receptors, 5HT-3 receptors, sigma-2
      sites, sodium channels and the serotonin transporter. 18-MC has low microM
      affinities at all three opioid receptors and at 5HT-3 receptors but much lower or
      no affinities for NMDA and sigma-2 receptors, sodium channels, and the 5HT
      transporter. Both 18-MC and ibogaine are sequestered in fat and, like ibogaine,
      18-MC probably has an active metabolite. 18-MC also has (+) and (-) enantiomers, 
      both of which are active. Considered together, all of the data indicate that
      18-MC should be safer than ibogaine and at least as efficacious as an
      anti-addictive medication.

TI  - Interactions between 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) and cocaine: dissociation of 
      behavioural and neurochemical sensitization.
PG  - 245-58
AB  - The phenomenon of sensitization has been implicated in various aspects of drug
      addiction. As such, the present study determined the effects of a potential
      anti-addictive agent, 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC; 40 mg/kg, IP, 19 h earlier),
      on the expression of sensitization following the repeated administration of
      cocaine (COC; five once daily injections of 15 mg/kg, IP) or saline. The effects 
      of 18-MC on COC metabolism were also assessed. Compared to vehicle controls,
      18-MC significantly enhanced the expression of COC-induced locomotion (0, 10, 20 
      and 40 mg/kg, IP) in chronic COC treated rats only. In both acute and chronic COC
      rats, 18-MC potentiated the stereotypy induced by higher COC doses (20 and 40
      mg/kg, IP). In contrast, 18-MC abolished the sensitized dopamine (DA) response in
      the nucleus accumbens (NAC) to COC (20 mg/kg), without altering the DA response
      of acute COC rats. None of the interactions between 18-MC and COC appear to be
      related to alterations in COC metabolism as no effect of 18-MC pretreatment was
      observed on extracellular levels of COC or two of its metabolites,
      benzoylecogonine and norcocaine. From the present findings, it is concluded that 
      the enhancement of COC-induced behaviour produced by 18-MC pretreatment is
      independent of effects on either COC pharmacokinetics or COC-induced alterations 
      in DA transmission. However, given that 18-MC decreases the self-administration
      of COC in laboratory animals, it is proposed that the anti-addictive efficacy of 
      18-MC might be related to an ability to selectively block the expression of
      sensitized extracellular levels of DA in the NAC in rats with previous COC
      experience.

TI  - Comparative neurobiological effects of ibogaine and MK-801 in rats.
PG  - 143-51
AB  - Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid with putative 'anti-addictive' properties.
      Although ibogaine binds to multiple targets in the brain, recent evidence
      suggests the drug acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist similar to
      MK-801. The purpose of the present study was to compare neurochemical and
      neuroendocrine effects of ibogaine and MK-801 in vivo. Male rats received either 
      i.p. saline, ibogaine (10 and 100 mg/kg), or MK-801 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). Groups of 
      rats (N=6-8/group) were decapitated 30 or 60 min after injection. Brains were
      harvested for analysis of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, while trunk blood
      was collected for analysis of plasma corticosterone and prolactin. Ibogaine
      produced marked dose-dependent reductions in tissue DA with concurrent increases 
      in the metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid 
      (HVA). This profile of ibogaine-induced effects on DA metabolism was consistently
      observed in the cortex, striatum, olfactory tubercle, and hypothalamus. MK-801,
      on the other hand, did not reduce DA levels in any brain region but did cause
      modest region-specific elevations in DA metabolites. Ibogaine and MK-801 caused
      comparable elevations in circulating corticosterone, but only ibogaine increased 
      prolactin. The present findings show that the effects of ibogaine on DA
      neurotransmission and neuroendocrine secretion are not fully mimicked by MK-801. 
      Thus, the wide spectrum of in vivo actions of ibogaine can probably not be
      explained simply on the basis of antagonism at NMDA receptors.

TI  - 18-MC reduces methamphetamine and nicotine self-administration in rats.
PG  - 2013-5
AB  - In previous studies, 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a novel iboga alkaloid
      congener, has been found to decrease the intravenous self-administration of
      morphine and cocaine in rats. In the present study, 18-MC (1-40 mg/kg, i.p.)
      dose-dependently decreased the i.v. self-administration of methamphetamine and
      nicotine. As in the previous studies, drug self-administration was reduced for > 
      or = 24 h after the highest dose of 18-MC. A comparison of 18-MC's interactions
      with all four drugs of abuse studied so far indicated that 18-MC is least
      effective in decreasing methamphetamine self-administration and most potent in
      decreasing nicotine self-administration. The results suggest that a nicotinic
      antagonist action of 18-MC contributes to its putative anti-addictive efficacy.

TI  - Differential effects of ibogaine on behavioural and dopamine sensitization to
      cocaine.
PG  - 259-62
AB  - To investigate a possible basis for the proposed anti-addictive property of
      ibogaine, the effects of ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p., 19 h earlier) on the
      expression of sensitization induced by cocaine were investigated. Ibogaine
      pretreatment potentiated the increase in the stereotypic effects of a cocaine
      challenge (20 mg/kg) in both sensitized (5 x 15 mg/kg, i.p.) and acutely treated 
      rats. However, while ibogaine pretreatment did not significantly alter the
      dopamine response in the nucleus accumbens to acute cocaine, it abolished the
      expression of cocaine-induced dopamine sensitization. This result demonstrates
      that ibogaine pretreatment can reverse one of the neuroadaptations produced by
      chronic cocaine administration, an effect that may contribute to its putative
      anti-addictive property.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic characterization of the indole alkaloid ibogaine in rats.
PG  - 77-81
AB  - To investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of ibogaine, a putatively
      anti-addictive alkaloid, levels of this drug were quantified in plasma and
      tissues for up to 3 h following i.v. infusion in rats. Immediately following a
      31-35 min infusion (20 mg/kg), mean plasma ibogaine levels were 373 ng/ml; these 
      values declined rapidly thereafter in a biexponential manner. The plasma time
      course in 5 of 7 animals demonstrated an excellent fit to a two-compartment
      pharmacokinetic model, with alpha and beta half-lives of 7.3 min and 3.3 h,
      respectively. Drug clearance was estimated to be 5.9 l/h (n = 7). Ibogaine levels
      in brain, liver and kidney 3 h after the end of drug infusion were 143-170 ng/g, 
      close to simulated values for the peripheral pharmacokinetic compartment.
      However, 3-h drug levels in adipose tissue were much higher (3,328 ng/g),
      implying the need for a more complex pharmacokinetic model. Mechanisms for the
      initial, rapid disappearance of plasma ibogaine are thought to include metabolic 
      demethylation as well as redistribution to body stores. The sequestration of
      ibogaine by adipose tissue probably contributes to a protracted persistence of
      drug in the body. This persistence may be underestimated by the beta half-life
      reported in the present study.

TI  - The potential anti-addictive agent, 18-methoxycoronaridine, blocks the sensitized
      locomotor and dopamine responses produced by repeated morphine treatment.
PG  - 13-23
AB  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a novel synthetic iboga congener, attenuates the 
      reinforcing efficacy of morphine, disrupts some signs of morphine withdrawal in
      physically dependent rats and attenuates the dopamine response in the nucleus
      accumbens to acute morphine. The present study further investigated the
      interactions between 18-MC and morphine by examining the effects of 18-MC (40
      mg/kg, i.p., 19 h earlier) on the expression of dopamine sensitization in the
      nucleus accumbens in response to morphine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and on the dose-effect
      curves for morphine-induced locomotion (0-30 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats treated either 
      acutely or repeatedly (five, once daily, injections of 20 mg/kg, i.p.) with
      morphine. Compared to vehicle pretreated controls, 18-MC increased the potency of
      morphine, shifting the dose-response curve to the left, in acute morphine treated
      rats; however, 18-MC did not alter the potency of morphine in rats treated
      repeatedly with morphine. Repeated morphine administration induced locomotor
      sensitization in approximately 50% of the rats tested; in vehicle pretreated
      rats, the morphine dose-response curve was shifted to the left in sensitized as
      compared to non-sensitized rats. In 18-MC pretreated rats, sensitized and
      non-sensitized rats responded similarly to morphine, revealing a blockade of
      sensitization by 18-MC. Consistent with this behavioural finding, 18-MC
      pretreatment completely abolished the sensitized dopamine response in the nucleus
      accumbens expressed by rats repeatedly treated with morphine. It is suggested
      that the potential anti-addictive efficacy of 18-MC might be related to an
      ability to restore normal functioning to a hypersensitive mesolimbic dopamine
      system produced by previous repeated morphine administration.

TI  - Pharmacological comparison of the effect of ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine
      on isolated smooth muscle from the rat and guinea-pig.
PG  - 1561-8
AB  - Ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine are naturally occurring alkaloids reported to
      possess antiaddictive properties in several models of drug dependence. We have
      examined their effect at mu-opioid receptors regulating neurogenic contractions
      of several smooth muscle preparations and also against spontaneous contractions
      of the rat isolated portal vein. Ibogaine (pIC(50) 5.28) and
      18-methoxycoronaridine (pIC(50) 5.05) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition
      of cholinergic contractions of the guinea-pig ileum which was not affected by the
      opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 microM). In the rat isolated vas deferens 
      ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine caused a concentration-dependent enhancement 
      of purinergic contractions. Both agents (30 microM) caused a 3 - 5 fold rightward
      displacement of DAMGO-induced inhibition of purinergic contractions, but similar 
      effects were observed for ibogaine against alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated
      inhibition of neurogenic responses. In the guinea-pig isolated bladder both
      ibogaine (10 microM) and 18-methoxycoronaridine (10 microM) caused a 2 fold
      increase in the purinergic component of neurogenic contractions without
      significantly altering cholinergic contractions or responses to exogenous ATP. In
      contrast, ibogaine (1 - 30 microM), but not 18-methoxycoronaridine, caused a
      concentration-dependent enhancement of spontaneous contractions of the rat
      isolated portal vein. In summary, while ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine
      modulated electrically-evoked contractions in the three preparations examined, we
      have no evidence for a selective interaction with pre-junctional mu-opioid
      receptors. The pronounced enhancement of purinergic contractions produced by both
      agents is a novel finding and worthy of further investigation.

TI  - Responses of the extrapyramidal and limbic substance P systems to ibogaine and
      cocaine treatments.
PG  - 119-26
AB  - Ibogaine is an indolamine found in the West Africa shrub, Tabernanthe iboga, and 
      has been proposed for the treatment of addiction to central nervous system (CNS) 
      stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. The mechanism of ibogaine action and 
      its suitability as a treatment for drug addiction still remains unclear. Since
      previous studies demonstrated differential effects of stimulants of abuse
      (amphetamines) on neuropeptide systems such as substance P, we examined the
      impact of ibogaine and cocaine on extrapyramidal (striatum and substantia nigra) 
      and limbic (nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex) substance P-like
      immunoreactivity. Ibogaine and cocaine treatments altered substance P systems by 
      increasing striatal and nigral substance P-like immunoreactivity concentration 12
      h after the last drug treatment. However, substance P-like immunoreactivity
      content was not significantly increased in nucleus accumbens after treatment with
      either drug. The ibogaine- and cocaine-induced increases in substance P-like
      immunoreactivity in striatum and substantia nigra were blocked by
      coadministration of selective dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist (SCH 23390;
      R(+)-7-Chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine
      hydrochloride) or dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist (eticlopride;
      S(-)-3-Chloro-5-ethyl-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-6-hydroxy-2-
      methoxy-benzamide hydrochloride). Most of the responses by substance P systems to
      ibogaine administration resembled those caused by cocaine, except in cortical
      tissue where multiple administration of cocaine, but not ibogaine increased
      substance P-like immunoreactivity. These data suggest that substance P systems
      may contribute to the effects of ibogaine and cocaine treatment.

TI  - Modulation of cellular calcium by sigma-2 receptors: release from intracellular
      stores in human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells.
PG  - 900-11
AB  - Human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells expressed sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors with
      similar pharmacological profiles to those of rodent-derived tissues, although
      sigma-2 receptors exhibited some affinity differences that might suggest
      heterogeneity or species differences. Structurally diverse sigma ligands produced
      two types of increases in intracellular (cytosolic) Ca(2+) concentration
      ([Ca(2+)](i)) in these cells. CB-64D, CB-64L, JL-II-147, BD737, LR172, BD1008,
      haloperidol, reduced haloperidol, and ibogaine all produced an immediate,
      dose-dependent, and transient rise in [Ca(2+)](i). Sigma-inactive compounds
      structurally similar to the most active sigma ligands and ligands for several
      neurotransmitter receptors produced little or no effect. The high activity of
      CB-64D and ibogaine (sigma-2-selective ligands) compared with the low activity of
      (+)-pentazocine and other (+)-benzomorphans (sigma-1-selective ligands), in
      addition to enantioselectivity for CB-64D over CB-64L, strongly indicated
      mediation by sigma-2 receptors. The effect of CB-64D and BD737 was blocked by the
      sigma antagonists BD1047 and BD1063, further confirming specificity as a
      receptor-mediated event. The transient rise in [Ca(2+)](i) occurred in the
      absence of extracellular Ca(2+) and was completely eliminated by pretreatment of 
      cells with thapsigargin. Thus, sigma-2 receptors stimulate a transient release of
      Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum. Prolonged exposure of cells to
      sigma-receptor ligands resulted in a latent and sustained rise in [Ca(2+)](i),
      with a pharmacological profile identical to that of the transient rise. This
      sustained rise in [Ca(2+)](i) was affected by neither the removal of
      extracellular Ca(2+) nor thapsigargin pretreatment, suggesting latent sigma-2
      receptor-induced release from thapsigargin-insensitive intracellular Ca(2+)
      stores. Sigma-2 receptors may use Ca(2+) signals in producing cellular effects.

TI  - Fluoro-Jade: novel fluorochromes for detecting toxicant-induced neuronal
      degeneration.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - Two anionic fluorescein derivatives can be used for the simple and definitive
      localization of neuronal degeneration in brain tissue sections. Initial work on
      the first generation fluorochrome, Fluoro-Jade, demonstrated the utility of this 
      compound for the detection of neuronal degeneration induced by a variety of
      well-characterized neurotoxicants, including kainic acid, 3-nitropropionic acid, 
      isoniazid, ibogaine, domoic acid, and dizocilpine maleate (MK-801). After
      validation, the tracer was used to reveal previously unreported sites of neuronal
      degeneration associated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP),
      methamphetamine, and d-fenfluramine. Preliminary findings with a second
      generation fluorescein derivative, Fluoro-Jade B, suggest that this tracer
      results in staining of optimal contrast and resolution in animals dosed with
      kainic acid. These 2 tracers can be combined with other histologic methods,
      including immunofluoresence and fluorescent Nissl stains. Recent preliminary
      findings on a number of specialized applications of Fluoro-Jade include the
      detection of apoptosis, amyloid plaques, astrocytes, and dead cells in tissue
      culture.

TI  - Acute ibogaine injection induces expression of the immediate early genes, egr-1
      and c-fos, in mouse brain.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate if an acute injection of ibogaine
      (IBO) induces immediate early gene expression in different regions of mouse
      brain. Adult male C57 mice received a single injection of IBO and were perfused
      transcardially with 1% paraformaldehyde 30 min after the drug administration. A
      single injection of IBO produced a significant increase of egr-1 messenger RNA
      induction in nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate-putamen (CPu), frontal cortex
      (FCx), septum, dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 region of hippocampus, whereas c-fos
      gene was induced in CPu, FCx, DG, septum and CA1 region of hippocampus. This gene
      expression may be due, in part, to the stimulant properties of IBO, as we found
      with other psychostimulants.

TI  - Behavioral effects and anticonvulsant efficacies of low-affinity, uncompetitive
      NMDA antagonists in mice.
PG  - 280-9
AB  - RATIONALE: It has been hypothesized that low-affinity, uncompetitive
      N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists may have therapeutic efficacy (e.g., in
      epilepsy, stroke, drug dependence) without the adverse side effects associated
      with high-affinity ligands (e.g., dizocilpine, phencyclidine). OBJECTIVES: To
      determine whether low-affinity NMDA antagonists have a larger predicted
      therapeutic window than high-affinity ligands. METHODS: In Swiss-Webster mice, we
      compared the effects of uncompetitive antagonists having a range of affinities
      for the NMDA receptor ion channel [dizocilpine, memantine, ibogaine, amantadine
      and 5-aminocarbonyl-10, 11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine (ADCI)]
      in three behavioral assays typically used to assess NMDA receptor antagonism.
      Behavioral side effects were compared with the efficacy of the compounds to
      protect against NMDA-induced seizures. RESULTS: Only dizocilpine and memantine
      substituted fully in mice trained to discriminate dizocilpine from saline.
      Dizocilpine (K(i) approximately 0.003 microM) protected against NMDA-induced
      convulsions at doses that produced ataxia and stimulation of locomotor activity. 
      Conversely, memantine (K(i) approximately 0.54 microM) prevented convulsions at
      doses that were 8- to 18-fold lower than those producing ataxia or effects on
      locomotion, respectively. Indeed, in contrast to dizocilpine, memantine did not
      stimulate locomotor activity but only produced dose-dependent reductions. The
      low-affinity antagonists ibogaine (K(i) approximately 1 microM) and ADCI (K(i)
      approximately 11 microM) protected against convulsions at doses that produced
      significant dizocilpine-like discriminative stimulus effects, ataxia and
      decreases in locomotor activity. Amantadine (K(i) approximately 11 microM) was
      ineffective against NMDA-induced convulsions up to doses that produced
      significant behavioral side effects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that
      only certain low-affinity, uncompetitive NMDA antagonists (e.g., memantine) may
      have therapeutic efficacy at doses that do not produce an adverse side-effect
      profile. For other therapeutic endpoints, different estimates of efficacy and
      safety require derivation.

TI  - Ibogaine pretreatment dramatically enhances the dynorphin response to cocaine.
PG  - 139-42
AB  - Ibogaine (Endabuse) is a psychoactive indole alkaloid found in the shrub,
      Tabernanthe iboga, which has been used to treat stimulant addiction. Because
      ibogaine influences the activity of neurotensin systems, a dopamine-linked
      neuropeptide, the present study investigated if ibogaine also influences
      dynorphin (DYN) pathways. Unlike neurotensin responses, ibogaine alone did not
      alter DYN levels in the striatum, substantia nigra or nucleus accumbens.
      Interestingly, ibogaine pretreatment dramatically enhanced cocaine-induced
      increases in DYN content in these structures.

TI  - Attenuation of the reinforcing efficacy of morphine by 18-methoxycoronaridine.
PG  - 15-21
AB  - In previous studies, 18-methoxycoronaridine, a novel iboga alkaloid congener, has
      been reported to decrease the self-administration of morphine, cocaine, ethanol
      and nicotine, and to attenuate naltrexone-precipitated signs of morphine
      withdrawal. In the present study, the nature of the interaction between
      18-methoxycoronaridine and morphine was further investigated. Using in vivo
      microdialysis, 18-methoxycoronaridine pretreatment (40 mg/kg i.p., 19 h
      beforehand) was found to markedly inhibit morphine-induced (5 mg/kg, i.p.)
      dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and striatum; 18-methoxycoronaridine
      also enhanced morphine-induced increases in extracellular levels of dopamine's
      metabolites. These effects, which were more prominent in the nucleus accumbens
      than in the striatum, suggest that 18-methoxycoronaridine selectively interferes 
      with morphine-induced dopamine release, without altering morphine-induced
      stimulation of dopamine synthesis. In intravenous morphine self-administration
      experiments, the effects of acute 18-methoxycoronaridine treatment (40 mg/kg,
      p.o.) were assessed in rats responding for one of several different unit infusion
      dosages of morphine (0.01-0.16 mg/kg/infusion). 18-Methoxycoronaridine produced a
      downward shift in the entire morphine dose-response curve without any
      displacement to the left or right. These results suggest that
      18-methoxycoronaridine reduced the reinforcing efficacy of morphine without
      altering its apparent potency. Together, the microdialysis and
      self-administration data suggest that 18-methoxycoronaridine profoundly alters
      mechanisms crucial to the development and maintenance of opioid addiction.

TI  - Long-term stability of abused drugs and antiabuse chemotherapeutical agents
      stored at -20 degrees C.
PG  - 535-40
AB  - Stability is an important consideration in the use of specimens for accurate
      determination of analyte concentrations. To determine the long-term stability for
      analytes routinely analyzed by mass spectrometry in this laboratory,
      quality-control (QC) results were plotted versus time. The time required for the 
      initial concentration to reach a specified level of deviation (i.e., 15%) was
      then determined from the slopes. QCs were prepared at 1-3 concentrations in
      drug-free matrix and stored at approximately -20 degrees C; urines were fortified
      with 1% sodium fluoride; plasmas (except for cocaines) were prepared with
      heparin. For cocaine and metabolites, the plasma was either fortified with 2%
      sodium fluoride or with 2% sodium fluoride and 1 mg% physostigmine after
      adjustment of the plasma pH to 6.0. In urine, amphetamine, methamphetamine,
      codeine, morphine, benzoylecgonine (BZE), and
      11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCA) slopes did not exceed a 15%
      deviation before 852 days. Cocaine, however, reached a 15% reduction at 165 days.
      When cocaine and BZE were prepared in plasma with just 2% sodium fluoride,
      negative slopes reached 15% deviation within 154 and 111 days, respectively.
      Further fortification with physostigmide and adjustment of the pH extended this
      time frame significantly. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and THCA in plasma
      had negative slopes that deviated by 15% just prior to one year.
      l-Alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM), methadone, and their N-demethylated metabolites in
      urine did not have any negative slopes exceeding 15% before 686 days. Several of 
      the compounds had positive slopes. Those for
      2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine reached the 15% mark within 98 
      days. Those for LAAM, norLAAM, and dinorLAAM were concentration dependent. The
      25-ng/mL controls reached 15% at 158-216 days. The 700-ng/mL controls reached 15%
      at 784-1340 days. In plasma, only naltrexone and buprenorphine displayed negative
      slopes at all three concentrations, reaching the 15% mark as early as 576 and 272
      days, respectively. LAAM, norLAAM, dinorLAAM, ibogaine, 6-beta-naltrexone,
      risperidone, and 9-OH-risperidone did not exceed a 15% deviation before 416 days.
      To attempt to validate this method, two sets of clinical plasma samples that had 
      been analyzed for buprenorphine were reanalyzed 644 and 869 days after the
      initial analyses. Those reanalyzed after 644 days were not statistically
      different from initial analyses, whereas those stored for 869 days were
      statistically different (p < 0.05). As the average time to reach 15% deviation
      for the three concentrations of buprenorphine QCs was 782 days, this suggests
      that extrapolation of QC results gathered over time may provide a reliable method
      to estimate long-term stability limits for drugs stored under the same conditions
      as the QC samples.

TI  - Treatment of acute opioid withdrawal with ibogaine.
PG  - 234-42
AB  - Ibogaine is an alkaloid with putative effect in acute opioid withdrawal.
      Thirty-three cases of treatments for the indication of opioid detoxification
      performed in non-medical settings under open label conditions are summarized
      involving an average daily use of heroin of .64 +/- .50 grams, primarily by the
      intravenous route. Resolution of the signs of opioid withdrawal without further
      drug seeking behavior was observed within 24 hours in 25 patients and was
      sustained throughout the 72-hour period of posttreatment observation. Other
      outcomes included drug seeking behavior without withdrawal signs (4 patients),
      drug abstinence with attenuated withdrawal signs (2 patients), drug seeking
      behavior with continued withdrawal signs (1 patient), and one fatality possibly
      involving surreptitious heroin use. The reported effectiveness of ibogaine in
      this series suggests the need for systematic investigation in a conventional
      clinical research setting.

TI  - Pretreatment with the putative anti-addictive drug, ibogaine, increases the
      potency of cocaine to elicit locomotor responding: a study with acute and chronic
      cocaine-treated rats.
PG  - 227-33
AB  - RATIONALE: Results of single-dose studies suggest that the effects of
      pretreatment with the putative anti-addictive compound, ibogaine, on drug-induced
      locomotor behavior depends on the previous drug history of the animal.
      OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of ibogaine pretreatment on the dose-locomotor
      response function for cocaine in rats treated chronically with either saline or
      cocaine. METHODS: Rats were chronically treated with either cocaine (15 mg/kg,
      IP, once daily for 5 days, followed by 2 week withdrawal) or saline. Ibogaine (40
      mg/kg, IP) or vehicle was administered and 19 h later, a cocaine dose-locomotor
      response test was conducted (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, IP). RESULTS: Chronic
      cocaine administration augmented the locomotor response to cocaine in chronic
      cocaine-treated rats, compared to acutely treated controls. Ibogaine pretreatment
      enhanced the locomotor effects of cocaine in both chronic and acute cocaine
      groups. Furthermore, due to the shape of the dose-response curve, in chronic
      cocaine but not in acute cocaine rats, ibogaine pretreatment enhanced the
      locomotor response to 5 and 10 mg/kg cocaine while decreasing the locomotor
      response to 40 mg/kg cocaine. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate definitively
      that ibogaine can enhance sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant effects of
      cocaine, an effect which depends, in part, on the previous cocaine history of the
      animal.

TI  - The acute effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors on the stimulus effects of
      hallucinogens.
PG  - 507-13
AB  - In a previous study it was observed that fluoxetine potentiates the stimulus
      effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). In the present investigation,
      stimulus control was established in groups of rats using as training drugs the
      hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); 0.1 mg/kg),
      (-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine [(-)-DOM; 0.56 mg/kg], ibogaine (10 mg/kg),
      and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT; 3 mg/kg). A two-lever,
      fixed-ratio 10, positively reinforced task with saline controls was employed. The
      hypotheses tested were that (a) monoamine uptake inhibitors other than fluoxetine
      potentiate the discriminative effects of LSD, and (b) hallucinogens other than
      LSD are potentiated by acute pretreatment with monoamine uptake inhibitors. The
      effects of a range of doses of each of the training drugs were determined both
      alone and following pretreatment with the monoamine reuptake inhibitors
      fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and venlafaxine. In LSD-trained subjects, all three
      reuptake inhibitors caused a significant increase in LSD-appropriate responding. 
      Similar results were observed in rats trained with (-)-DOM and with ibogaine. In 
      5-MeO-DMT-trained subjects, only fluoxetine resulted in an enhancement of
      drug-appropriate responding. The reuptake inhibitors given alone elicited varying
      degrees of responses appropriate for the respective training drugs. For
      fluoxetine in rats trained with LSD and ibogaine, for venlafaxine in LSD trained,
      and for fluvoxamine in (-)-DOM trained, the degree of responding met our
      criterion for intermediate responding, i.e., significantly different from both
      training conditions. Subsequent experiments in (-)-DOM-trained subjects examined 
      a range of doses of each of the reuptake inhibitors in combination with a fixed
      dose of (-)-DOM (0.1 mg/kg), which alone yielded about 50% (-)-DOM-appropriate
      responding. With the exception of the point obtained with the highest dose of
      venlafaxine, all data were compatible with additivity of effects rather than true
      potentiation. In summary, the present data extend our previous observation of the
      augmentation of the stimulus effects of LSD by fluoxetine to include other
      hallucinogens. The mechanisms by which these interactions arise and possible
      differential effects of acute and chronic treatment remain to be established.

TI  - Ibogaine enhances the expression of locomotor sensitization in rats chronically
      treated with cocaine.
PG  - 457-64
AB  - Pretreatment (19 h) with the putative antiaddictive agent, ibogaine, has been
      shown previously to potentiate cocaine-induced locomotion in rats. The present
      study demonstrates that the magnitude of this effect of ibogaine is dependent on 
      the previous cocaine history of the animal, on the time following ibogaine
      treatment, and on the number of ibogaine treatments. Compared to rats with no
      previous cocaine experience, ibogaine pretreatment (40 mg/kg, IP, 19 h earlier)
      markedly enhanced the expression of locomotor sensitization in response to a
      cocaine challenge injection (7.5 mg/kg) in rats that were chronically treated
      with cocaine (15 mg/ kg, IP, daily for 5 days). Tolerance to cocaine-induced
      locomotor sensitization appeared to occur in vehicle-pretreated chronic cocaine
      controls. Following a second series of identical treatments (beginning 3-4 days
      after the initial treatment series), locomotor responding to the cocaine
      challenge was further enhanced by a second ibogaine injection in chronically
      cocaine-treated animals. Twenty-four hours later, when animals were challenged
      again with cocaine in the absence of any further ibogaine pretreatment, the
      effect of ibogaine had dissipated. Consistent with previous studies from this
      laboratory, these data demonstrate that ibogaine can enhance sensitivity to the
      psychomotor stimulant effect of cocaine. The results of the present study further
      indicate that the extent of this effect depends on the animal's history of
      exposure to both ibogaine and cocaine.

AB  - Ibogaine has been shown to affect biogenic amine levels in selected brain
      regions. Because of the involvement of these neurotransmitters in drug addiction,

      synaptosomes as our experimental system, we measured the effects of ibogaine on
      the uptake and release of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT). Ibogaine
      competitively blocked both DA and 5-HT uptake with IC50 values of 20 microM at 75
      nM 3H-DA and 2.6 microM at 10 nM 3H-5-HT. Ibogaine had no effect on K+-induced
      release of 3H-DA from preloaded synaptosomes, but 20 microM and 50 microM
      ibogaine inhibited roughly 40% and 60%, respectively, of the K(+)-induced release
      of 3H-5-HT from preloaded synaptosomes. In the absence of a depolarizing
      stimulus, ibogaine evoked a small release of 3H-DA but not 3H-5-HT. These
      relatively low-potency effects of ibogaine on DA and 5-HT uptake in synaptosomes 
      are consistent with the low binding affinity of ibogaine that has been previously
      reported for DA and 5-HT transporters. Our results show that if ibogaine
      modulates DA and 5-HT levels in the brain by directly blocking their uptake, then
      a concentration of ibogaine in the micromolar range is required. Furthermore, if 
      the anti-addictive effects of ibogaine require this concentration, then ibogaine 
      likely exerts these effects through a combination of neurotransmitter pathways,
      because binding affinities and functional potencies of ibogaine in the micromolar
      range have been reported for a variety of neuronal receptors and transporters.

      concentration in rat brain.
PG  - 119-26
AB  - The discriminative stimulus effects of ibogaine and noribogaine in rats have been
      examined in relation to their concentrations in blood plasma and brain regions
      and to receptor systems through which they have been proposed to act. Rats were
      trained to discriminate ibogaine (10 mg/kg i.p.), the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine
      (0.08 mg/kg i.p.) or the kappa-opioid agonist U50,488 (5 mg/kg i.p.) from vehicle
      in a standard two-lever operant conditioning procedure with a tandem VI-FR
      schedule of food reinforcement. Only rats trained on ibogaine generalized to
      noribogaine, which was approximately twice as potent as the parent compound.
      Noribogaine was detected in plasma and brain after administration of ibogaine and
      noribogaine. At the ED50 doses for the discriminative effect, the estimated
      concentrations of noribogaine in plasma, cerebral cortex, and striatum were
      similar regardless of whether ibogaine or noribogaine was administered. The
      findings suggest that the metabolite noribogaine may be devoid of NMDA antagonist
      and kappa-opioid agonist discriminative effects and that it may play a major role
      in mediating the discriminative stimulus effect of ibogaine.

PG  - 317-26
AB  - 1. 5-HT3, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptor ligands were assessed in rats trained to
      discriminate ibogaine from water. 2. Significant ibogaine-appropriate responding 
      was observed following treatment with the 5-HT2C agonists MK-212 (79.6%) and mCPP
      (76.4%). This substitution was completely antagonized by metergoline, an agent
      with 5-HT2C antagonist properties. However, metergoline was ineffective against
      ibogaine itself. This suggests that although ibogaine may act as an agonist at
      5-HT2C receptors, this interaction is not essential to its discriminative cue. 3.
      Neither the 5-HT3 agonist, mCPBG (44.3%), nor the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron
      (48.9%) substituted for ibogaine. Likewise, the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (34.7%) 
      and the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (30.1%) failed to substitute. Furthermore,
      WAY-100635 failed to antagonize the ibogaine cue. 4. Unlike 5-HT2C receptors,
      5-HT1A and 5-HT3 receptors do not appear to be involved in the ibogaine stimulus.

PG  - 213-6
AB  - Body temperature changes and heat shock protein (HSP-72) induction in the caudate
      nucleus were studied in female C57BL/6N mice pretreated with ibogaine (50 mg/kg) 
      and sacrificed 48 h. after a single dose of methamphetamine (20 mg/kg).
      Methamphetamine injection resulted in hyperthermia and induced HSP-72 expression,
      whereas treatment with ibogaine alone produced hypothermia. The ibogaine followed
      by methamphetamine injection showed no hyperthermia and decreased HSP-72
      expression. These data indicate that pretreatment with ibogaine can completely
      block methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia and HSP-72 expression in the striatum.

TI  - Differential responses by neurotensin systems in extrapyramidal and limbic
      structures to ibogaine and cocaine.
PG  - 96-104
AB  - Ibogaine (Endabuse) is a psychoactive indole alkaloid found in the West African
      shrub, Tabernanthe iboga. This drug interrupts cocaine and amphetamine abuse and 
      has been proposed for treatment of addiction to these stimulants. However, the
      mechanism of action that explains its pharmacological properties is unclear.
      Since previous studies demonstrated differential effects of psychotomimetic drugs
      (cocaine and methamphetamine) on neuropeptides such as neurotensin (NT), the
      present study was designed to determine: (1) the effects of ibogaine on striatal,
      nigral, cortical, and accumbens neurotensin-like immunoreactivity (NTLI); (2) the
      effects of selective dopamine antagonists on ibogaine-induced changes in NT
      concentrations in these brain areas; and (3) the effects of ibogaine pretreatment
      on cocaine-induced changes in striatal, nigral, cortical and accumbens NTLI
      content. Ibogaine treatments profoundly affected NT systems by increasing
      striatal, nigral, and accumbens NTLI content 12 h after the last drug
      administration. In contrast, NTLI concentrations were not significantly increased
      in the frontal cortex after ibogaine treatment. The ibogaine-induced increases in
      NTLI in striatum, nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra were blocked by
      coadministration of the selective D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390. The D2
      receptor antagonist, eticlopride, blocked the ibogaine-induced increase in nigral
      NTLI, but not in striatum and nucleus accumbens. Ibogaine pretreatment
      significantly blocked the striatal and nigral increases of NTLI resulting from a 
      single cocaine administration. Whereas many of the responses by NT systems to
      ibogaine resembled those which occur after cocaine, there were also some
      important differences. These data suggest that NT may contribute to an
      interaction between ibogaine and the DA system and may participate in the
      pharmacological actions of this drug.

TI  - Noncompetitive functional inhibition at diverse, human nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptor subtypes by bupropion, phencyclidine, and ibogaine.
PG  - 88-92
AB  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are diverse members of the
      neurotransmitter-gated ion channel superfamily and play critical roles in
      chemical signaling throughout the nervous system. The present study establishes
      the acute functional effects of bupropion, phencyclidine, and ibogaine on two
      human nAChR subtypes. Function of muscle-type nAChR (alpha1 beta gamma delta) in 
      TE671/RD cells or of ganglionic nAChR (alpha3 beta4 alpha5+/-beta2) in SH-SY5Y
      neuroblastoma cells was measured with 86Rb+ efflux assays. Functional blockade of
      human muscle-type and ganglionic nAChR is produced by each of the drugs in the
      low to intermediate micromolar range. Functional blockade is insurmountable by
      increasing agonist concentrations in TE671/RD and SH-SY5Y cells for each of these
      drugs, suggesting noncompetitive inhibition of nAChR function. Based on these
      findings, we hypothesize that nAChR are targets of diverse substances of abuse
      and agents used in antiaddiction/smoking cessation strategies. We also
      hypothesize that nAChR play heretofore underappreciated roles in depression and
      as targets for clinically useful antidepressants.

      characterization of 3-ethyl-5-phenyl-1,2,3,4,5,
      6-hexahydroazepino[4,5-b]benzothiophenes.
PG  - 4486-91
AB  - Five phenyl-substituted derivatives and analogues of 1,2,3,4,5,
      6-hexahydroazepino[4,5-b]indole, 5, a major fragment of ibogaine (1), were
      synthesized and tested for binding to monoamine transporters, the NMDA
      receptor-coupled cation channel, and dopamine and opioid receptors. All five
      derivatives, 9 and 17a-d, displayed 8-10-fold higher affinity at the DA
      transporter than ibogaine and noribogaine (4). At the serotonin transporter, two 
      compounds (9 and 17a) exhibited higher potency than ibogaine, while the rest had 
      weaker binding affinities than the lead compound. In keeping with their
      structural similarity to ibogaine, all five compounds displayed weak to poor
      affinity for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. However, two compounds, 17a,c,
      demonstrated moderate binding affinities at dopamine D3 receptors. All five
      compounds displayed weak to poor affinities for mu and kappa opioid receptors and
      for the NMDA receptor-coupled cation channel. Despite the qualitative
      differences, derivatives and analogues of 5may serve as useful substitutes for
      ibogaine.

TI  - 18-Methoxycoronardine attenuates nicotine-induced dopamine release and nicotine
      preferences in rats.
PG  - 274-80
AB  - Two studies were conducted to assess, in vivo, potential anti-nicotinic effects
      of the iboga alkaloid ibogaine and its synthetic congener 18-methoxycoronaridine 
      (18-MC). As previously demonstrated for ibogaine, using microdialysis,
      pretreatment (19h beforehand) with 18-MC (40 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly
      attenuated nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of awake
      and freely moving rats. In an oral model of nicotine self-administration, both
      ibogaine and 18-MC decreased rats' preferences for nicotine for at least 24 h.
      Acutely, during the first hour after administration, ibogaine depressed
      responding for water as well as for nicotine; however, during this same time,
      18-MC reduced nicotine intake without affecting responding for water. The results
      suggest that 18-MC might be the prototype of a new treatment for smoking.

      morphine-tolerant mice.
PG  - 229-32
AB  - The effects of ibogaine, an alkaloid isolated form the bark of the African shrub,
      Tabernathe iboga, and noribogaine, a metabolite of ibogaine, on morphine
      antinociception were determined in male Swiss-Webster mice. Mice were rendered
      tolerant to morphine by implanting them with a pellet containing 25 mg of
      morphine base for 3 days. Placebo pellet-implanted mice served as controls. The
      antinociception of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) was determined alone or in
      combination with an appropriate dose of ibogaine or noribogaine. Tolerance to
      morphine developed as a result of morphine pellet implantation as evidenced by
      decreased antinociceptive response to morphine. Both ibogaine and noribogaine
      dose-dependently enhanced morphine antinociception in morphine-tolerant but not
      in morphine-naive mice. It is concluded that ibogaine and noribogaine enhance
      morphine antinociception in morphine-tolerant mice.

TI  - Gender differences in kappa-opioid modulation of cocaine-induced behavior and
      NMDA-evoked dopamine release.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - It has been reported that kappa-opioids produce greater analgesia in women than
      in men. Sex differences are also apparent in drug-induced behaviors. Repeated
      administration of cocaine (25 mg/kg) produced a greater locomotor and
      sensitization response in C57BL/6By female mice. It was examined whether the
      increased sensitization in females to repeated cocaine administration was related
      to differences in kappa-opioid responses. The effects of the kappa agonist U62066
      (spiradoline mesylate) on cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation in vivo and
      NMDA-mediated dopamine release in vitro were measured. In male, but not female
      mice, U62066 (1 mg/kg) given 30 min before cocaine potentiated the locomotor
      stimulation of an acute cocaine administration. U-62066 did not affect the
      development of locomotor sensitization with repeated cocaine administration (25
      mg/kg s.c., once daily for 3 days), and a further enhanced response was not seen 
      on days 2 and 3. It was then examined whether dopamine release, measured in
      vitro, plays a role in sex dependent differences in kappa-opioid- or
      NMDA-modulated dopaminergic function. In tissue perfusion studies, the in vitro
      NMDA (25 microM)-evoked release of labelled dopamine from striatum was lower in
      females (fractional release = 5.4 +/- 0.4 and 4.0 +/- 0.4 in male and female
      mouse striatum). U62066 (1 microM) and ibogaine (1 microM), an indole alkaloid
      claimed to be useful in the treatment of drug addiction that acts in part at the 
      kappa-opioid receptor, both reduced the NMDA (25 microM)-evoked release of
      dopamine. Inhibition of the release was significantly greater in tissue from male
      mice. Prior in vivo cocaine administration did not alter the NMDA-evoked dopamine
      release. Our studies indicate that kappa-opioid and NMDA receptor activity show
      differences between female and male mice that may account for differences in
      cocaine-induced behaviors, but do not exclude the role of other hetereoceptors
      modulating dopamine release.

TI  - Cytochrome P4502D6 catalyzes the O-demethylation of the psychoactive alkaloid
      ibogaine to 12-hydroxyibogamine.
PG  - 764-8
AB  - Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid that possesses potential as an agent to treat
      opiate and cocaine addiction. The primary metabolite arises via O-demethylation
      at the 12-position to yield 12-hydroxyibogamine. In this report, evidence is
      presented that the O-demethylation of ibogaine observed in human hepatic
      microsomes is catalyzed primarily by the polymorphically expressed cytochrome
      P-4502D6 (CYP2D6). An enzyme kinetic examination of ibogaine O-demethylase
      activity in pooled human liver microsomes suggested that two (or more) enzymes
      are involved in this reaction: one with a low KMapp (1.1 microM) and the other
      with a high KMapp (>200 microM). The low KMapp activity comprised >95% of total
      intrinsic clearance. Human liver microsomes from three individual donors
      demonstrated similar enzyme kinetic parameters (mean KMapp = 0.55 +/- 0.09 microM
      and 310 +/- 10 microM for low and high KM activities, respectively). However, a
      fourth human microsome sample that appeared to be a phenotypic CYP2D6 poor
      metabolizer possessed only the high KMapp activity. In hepatic microsomes from a 
      panel of human donors, the low KMapp ibogaine O-demethylase activity correlated
      with CYP2D6-catalyzed bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity but not with other P450
      isoform-specific activities. Quinidine, a CYP2D6-specific inhibitor, inhibited
      ibogaine O-demethylase (IC50 = 0.2 microM), whereas other P450 isoform-specific
      inhibitors did not inhibit this activity. Also, of a battery of recombinant
      heterologously expressed human P450 isoforms, only rCYP2D6 possessed significant 
      ibogaine O-demethylase activity. Thus, it is concluded that ibogaine
      O-demethylase is catalyzed by CYP2D6 and that this isoform is the predominant
      enzyme of ibogaine O-demethylation in humans. The potential pharmacological
      implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - Acute iboga alkaloid effects on extracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels in nucleus 
      accumbens and striatum in rats.
PG  - 260-8
AB  - The iboga alkaloid, ibogaine, its metabolite, noribogaine, and the congener,
      18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) have all been claimed to have anti-addictive
      properties in animal models, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are
      unclear. Ibogaine and noribogaine were shown to have affinity for the serotonin
      transporter, and inhibition of serotonin reuptake has been proposed to be
      involved in their anti-addictive actions. It is not known yet if 18-MC also has
      this property. In vivo microdialysis and HPLC (microbore) were used to determine 
      acute changes in extracellular serotonin levels in nucleus accumbens (NAC) and
      striatum (STR) after both i.p. (40 mg/kg for all drugs) and i.v. (1-10 mg/kg for 
      ibogaine and noribogaine) drug administration in awake freely moving female
      Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g). After i.p. administration, ibogaine, noribogaine
      and 18-MC had very different effects on extracellular serotonin levels in both
      NAC and STR: ibogaine elicited large increases (up to 25-fold in NAC and 10- fold
      in STR), noribogaine produced moderate increases (up to 8-fold in NAC and 5-fold 
      in STR), and 18-MC had no effect in either brain region. These and other data
      suggest that (1) the serotonergic system may not be an essential factor in the
      anti-addictive actions of these drugs; (2) ibogaine (or an unidentified
      metabolite) may release serotonin as well as inhibit its reuptake; (3)
      stimulation of the ascending serotonergic system may mediate ibogaine's
      hallucinogenic effect; and (4) 18-MC probably has no affinity for the serotonin
      transporter, and is unlikely to be a hallucinogen.

      following ibogaine treatment.
PG  - 265-73
AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is a psychoactive indole alkaloid that has antiaddictive
      properties. However, treatment with IBO may lead to neurotoxicity, since IBO and 
      its metabolites interact persistently with many neurotransmitter systems. Here,
      we recorded cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from rats anesthetized
      with isoflurane. The heart rate (HR) was monitored via electrocardiogram (EKG)
      electrodes. After the baseline EEG was recorded, rats received one
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of 50 mg/kg IBO. EEG signals were recorded for 2 hr. 
      Rats were then sacrificed and brains dissected into frontal cortex (FC), caudate 
      nucleus (CN), hippocampus (HIP), and brain stem (BS). The level of dopamine (DA),
      serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites were determined by high-performance
      liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Compared with
      baseline, a decrease in HR immediately after IBO injection and a decrease in
      delta, theta, alpha and beta power spectra frequency bands (1-4, 4-8, 8-13, 13-32
      Hz) during the first 30 min after IBO administration was observed. EEG recovered 
      within the next 15 min. In CN, the level of DA decreased and DA turnover rate
      increased significantly. The levels of 5-HT increased in FC. The pattern of EKG
      AND EEG response to IBO may be due to multiple receptor interactions of IBO.

TI  - Medication development of ibogaine as a pharmacotherapy for drug dependence.
PG  - 274-92
AB  - The potential for deriving new psychotherapeutic medications from natural sources
      has led to renewal interest in rain forest plants as a source of lead compounds
      for the development of antiaddiction medications. Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid 
      found in the roots of Tabernanthe iboga (Apocynaceae family), a rain forest shrub
      that is native to equatorial Africa. Ibogaine is used by indigenous peoples in
      low doses to combat fatigue, hunger and in higher doses as a sacrament in
      religious rituals. Members of American and European addict self-help groups have 
      claimed that ibogaine promotes long-term drug abstinence from addictive
      substances, including psychostimulants and cocaine. Anecdotal reports attest that
      a single dose of ibogaine eliminates withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug
      cravings for extended periods of time. The purported antiaddictive properties of 
      ibogaine require rigorous validation in humans. We have initiated a rising
      tolerance study using single administration to assess the safety of ibogaine for 
      treatment of cocaine dependency. The primary objectives of the study are to
      determine safety, pharmacokinetics and dose effects, and to identify relevant
      parameters of efficacy in cocaine-dependent patients. Pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic characteristics of ibogaine in humans are assessed by analyzing
      the concentration-time data of ibogaine and its desmethyl metabolite
      (noribogaine) from the Phase I trial, and by conducting in vitro experiments to
      elucidate the specific disposition processes involved in the metabolism of both
      parent drug and metabolite. The development of clinical safety studies of
      ibogaine in humans will help to determine whether there is a rationale for
      conducting efficacy trials in the future.

TI  - Neurochemical and neuroendocrine effects of ibogaine in rats: comparison to
      MK-801.
PG  - 252-64
AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is a naturally-occurring indole compound that is being evaluated
      as a potential medication for substance use disorders. Although the precise
      mechanism of IBO action is unclear, recent in vitro data show this drug displays 
      properties similar to the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist
      MK-801. The purpose of the present work was to compare in vivo neurobiological
      effects of IBO and MK-801 in rats. Groups of male rats (n = 6-8/group) were
      decapitated 30 and 60 min after receiving intraperitoneal (i.p.) IBO (10 & 100
      mg/kg), MK-801 (0.1 & 1.0 mg/kg) or vehicle. Trunk blood was collected for the
      analysis of plasma prolactin and corticosterone; brains were harvested and
      dissected for determination of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their
      metabolites. Both IBO and MK-801 increased corticosterone secretion, but only IBO
      elevated plasma prolactin. IBO produced dramatic reductions in tissue DA levels
      with concurrent increases in the metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) 
      and homovanillic acid (HVA). This profile of IBO-induced changes in DA
      transmission was observed in the striatum, olfactory tubercle, and hypothalamus. 
      The effects of MK-801 on DA metabolism did not mimic IBO, as MK-801 tended to
      increase DA and its metabolites. Neither drug appreciably affected 5-HT systems. 
      Our results suggest that the effects of IBO on neuroendocrine function and DA
      transmission are not due to MK-801-like properties of IBO. Thus, the in vivo
      mechanism of IBO action cannot be explained simply on the basis of antagonism at 
      NMDA receptors.

TI  - Effect of ibogaine on the various sites of the NMDA receptor complex and sigma
      binding sites in rat brain.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - Although the alkaloid ibogaine is a potent hallucinogenic agent some indications 
      suggest that it may be useful for the treatment of opioid and cocaine addiction. 
      The neurochemical mechanism(s) underlying ibogaine effects remain unclear. In the
      present study we investigated the interaction of ibogaine with the phencyclidine 
      (PCP) site located in the ionophore of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      complex, with the NMDA receptor binding site, and with sigma binding sites. In
      well-washed membrane preparations of rat cortex and cerebellum, the PCP sites
      were labeled with [3H]MK-801 or [3H]1-[1(2-theinyl)-cyclohexyl]-piperidine
      ([3H]TCP), and the NMDA receptor with [3H]-CGP 39653. The sigma-1 and sigma-2
      binding site in rat cortex and cerebellum were labeled with [3H]pentazocine and
      [3H]1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine ([3H]DTG), respectively. Results indicated that
      ibogaine interacts with high- and low-affinity PCP binding sites in the cortex:
      Ki(H) = 0.01-0.05 microM; Ki(L) = 2-4 microM, and only with low-affinity sites in
      the cerebellum: Ki = 2-4, microM. In contrast, ibogaine (> 100 microM) had no
      affinity for [3H]-CGP 39653 binding sites (cortex and cerebellum). The affinity
      of ibogaine for sigma-1 and -2 binding sites in cortex and cerebellum ranged from
      1.5-3 microM. Since NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., MK-801) are thought to
      attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms and cocaine sensitization, it is possible
      that binding of ibogaine to the PCP sites contributes to its potential 'endabuse'
      properties. In turn, ibogaine interaction with sigma binding sites may be
      associated with its adverse effects.

TI  - In vivo ibogaine blockade and in vitro PKC action of cocaine.
PG  - 227-44
AB  - Ibogaine may have antiaddiction potential against alcohol, psychostimulant and
      opiate abuse, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Ibogaine, however, has been
      demonstrated in numerous studies to have effects in multiple central nervous
      system (CNS) neurotransmitters systems. We are using in vitro and in vivo systems
      to study the effects of cocaine and whether these effects can be blocked by
      ibogaine. For the in vivo studies, we first determined the acute and subacute
      effects of ibogaine (1-5.0 mg/kg) in mice using the plus-maze test. Acutely
      increasing doses of ibogaine produced a reduced aversion to the open arms. The
      subacute administration provoked a variable response which was characterized by
      fluctuations in aversive and antiaversive behavior of the animals to the open
      arms of the plus-maze during the 14-day treatment period. A separate group of
      mice received 1.0 mg/kg cocaine for 14 days, and upon abrupt cessation from
      cocaine treatment, ibogaine 2.5 mg/kg was administered to a subgroup of these
      mice. Ibogaine reversed the withdrawal aversions produced by the abrupt cessation
      from cocaine administration. For the in vitro studies, the expression and
      activity of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and Ca2+ levels were examined
      following the incubation of PC 12 cells with cocaine. This is because PKC plays a
      key role in a number of cellular and neuronal functions. We report that cocaine
      disrupts signal transduction in PC 12 cells by altering the expression and
      activity of PKC isoforms and Ca2+ levels. The data obtained suggest (1) that the 
      PC 12 cells may be useful in studying the neurobiology of abused drugs, like
      cocaine in vitro, (2) that if anxiety is a factor in drug dependency, then the
      antiaddictive property of ibogaine in vivo may be associated with modifying the
      CNS neurotransmission that may be involved in anxiety. It remains to be
      determined whether the signaling involving PKC is important in the antiaddictive 
      properties of ibogaine.

TI  - Mechanisms of antiaddictive actions of ibogaine.
PG  - 214-26
AB  - Ibogaine, an alkaloid extracted from Tabemanthe iboga, is being studied as a
      potential long-acting treatment for oploid and stimulant abuse as well as for
      alcoholism and smoking. Studies in this laboratory have used animal models to
      characterize ibogaine's interactions with drugs of abuse, and to investigate the 
      mechanisms responsible. Ibogaine, as well as its metabolite, noribogaine, can
      decrease both morphine and cocaine self-administration for several days in some
      rats; shorter-lasting effects appear to occur on ethanol and nicotine intake.
      Acutely, both ibogaine and noribogaine decrease extracellular levels of dopamine 
      in the nucleus accumbens of rat brain. Ibogaine pretreatment (19 hours
      beforehand) blocks morphine-induced dopamine release and morphine-induced
      locomotor hyperactivity while, in contrast, it enhances similar effects of
      stimulants (cocaine and amphetamine). Ibogaine pretreatment also blocks
      nicotine-induced dopamine release. Both ibogaine and noribogaine bind to kappa
      opioid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and to serotonin uptake sites;
      ibogaine also binds to sigma-2 and nicotinic receptors. The relative
      contributions of these actions are being assessed. Our ongoing studies in rats
      suggest that kappa agonist and NMDA antagonist actions contribute to ibogaine's
      effects on opioid and stimulant self-administration, while the serotonergic
      actions may be more important for ibogaine-induced decreases in alcohol intake. A
      nicotinic antagonist action may mediate ibogaine-induced reduction of nicotine
      preferences in rats. A sigma-2 action of ibogaine appears to mediate its
      neurotoxicity. Some effects of ibogaine (e.g., on morphine and cocaine
      self-administration, morphine-induced hyperactivity, cocaine-induced increases in
      nucleus accumbens dopamine) are mimicked by kappa agonist (U50,488) and/or a NMDA
      antagonist (MK-801). Moreover, a combination of a kappa antagonist and a NMDA
      agonist will partially reverse several of ibogaine's effects. Ibogaine's
      long-term effects may be mediated by slow release from fat tissue (where ibogaine
      is sequestered) and conversion to noribogaine. Different receptors, or
      combinations of receptors, may mediate interactions of ibogaine with different
      drugs of abuse.

PG  - 1283-5
AB  - Ibogaine, an alkaloid found in the root bark of the African shrub Tabernanthe
      iboga, has been claimed to interrupt opioid dependence in humans; in animals, it 
      has been shown to inhibit morphine self-administration and to attenuate signs of 
      morphine withdrawal. However, ibogaine has some neurotoxicity, and because of
      this, efficacious and safer congeners of ibogaine have been sought,
      18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a novel iboga alkaloid congener, has been shown, 
      in animals, to mimic the effects of ibogaine on morphine self-administration
      without producing any ibogaine-like neurotoxiticity. In the present study, 18-MC 
      was shown to attenuate five of seven signs of morphine withdrawal in rats. The
      data suggest that 18-MC will ameliorate symptoms of opioid dependence in humans.

TI  - Ibogaine acts at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to inhibit catecholamine
      release.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - In an effort to determine mechanisms of action of the putative anti-addictive
      agent ibogaine, we have measured its effects on catecholamine release in a model 
      neuronal system, cultured bovine chromaffin cells. Various modes of stimulating
      catecholamine release were used including nicotinic ACh receptor activation,
      membrane depolarization with elevated K+ and Na+ channel activation with
      veratridine. In addition, because ibogaine has been reported to interact with
      kappa opioid receptors, we tested whether kappa receptor antagonists could
      reverse ibogaine's effects on catecholamine release. Ibogaine, at low
      concentration (<10 microM) was found to selectively inhibit nicotinic
      receptor-mediated catecholamine release, while having no significant effect on
      release evoked by either veratridine or membrane depolarization with elevated K+.
      The inhibitory actions of ibogaine and the kappa agonists were not reversed by
      preincubation with the opioid antagonists nor-binaltorphimine or naltrexone,
      suggesting that these inhibitory effects are not mediated by the kappa opioid
      receptor. The effects of low dose (10 microM) ibogaine were rapidly reversible,
      while the inhibitory effects of higher ibogaine doses persisted for at least 19 h
      following ibogaine washout. The results provide evidence for a mechanism of
      action ibogaine at the nicotinic ACh receptor. The results are consistent with a 
      model in which the initial high transient brain concentrations (100 microM) of
      ibogaine act at multiple cellular sites and then have a selective action at the
      nicotinic ACh receptor cation channel following its metabolism to lower brain
      concentrations. The present findings are relevant to potential anti-addictive
      actions of ibogaine and to the development of drugs to combat nicotine addiction.

TI  - Antimycobacterial activity of chemically defined natural substances from the
      Caribbean flora in Guadeloupe.
PG  - 267-73
AB  - Eight chemically defined, naturally occurring compounds were extracted from the
      tropical flora of the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe: pilocarpine, an alkaloid
      from Pilocarpus racemosus; heraclenol and isomeranzin, coumarins from Triphasia
      trifolia; lochnerin, an indole alkaloid from Rauwolfia biauriculata; ibogaine and
      voacangine, indole alkaloids from Tabernaemontana citrifolia; texalin, an oxazole
      from Amyris elemifera; and canellal, a sesquiterpene dialdehyde from Canella
      winterana. An essential oil fraction from Canella winterana was also tested. The 
      antimycobacterial activity of these substances was tested against Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis, M. avium and M. kansasii using the Middlebrook 7H11 agar medium,
      the Bactec 460-TB radiometric methodology, and determination of bacterial viable 
      counts. Three compounds, namely ibogaine, voacangine and texalin, showed
      antimycobacterial activity. Investigations on the structure-modification and
      structure-activity relationships of these compounds may help determine new
      targets for future drug development.

PG  - 139-43
AB  - The structural features and hallucinogenic properties shared by ibogaine and
      certain beta-carbolines prompted the evaluation of several representative
      beta-carbolines in rats trained with ibogaine as a discriminative stimulus. In a 
      previous report from our laboratory harmaline completely substituted for ibogaine
      (83.5%). In the present study, only 6-methoxyharmalan completely substituted
      (86.3%). However, partial substitution was observed with harmine, harmane,
      harmalol, and tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC). Norharmane and
      6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) failed to produce
      appreciable substitution. These results provide evidence for an ibogaine-like
      ether this extends to the previously reported anti-addictive effects of ibogaine 
      remains to be established.

TI  - Noribogaine stimulates naloxone-sensitive [35S]GTPgammaS binding.
PG  - 109-14
AB  - Noribogaine is formed in vivo by the O-demethylation of the indole alkaloid
      ibogaine. We report here that noribogaine acts as a full agonist at the mu-opioid
      receptor. Noribogaine-stimulated guanylyl 5'gamma-[35S]thio]triphosphate
      ([35S]GTPgammaS) was studied in rat thalamic membranes to measure activation of
      guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins) in the presence of excess GDP.
      Noribogaine caused a 170% increase above basal [35S]GTPgammaS binding at
      sub-micromolar effective concentrations (EC50) in a naloxone-sensitive manner,
      confirming that this effect was an opioid receptor-mediated process. The level of
      intrinsic activity for noribogaine in these assays was comparable to the full
      agonists DAMGO and morphine. In contrast, ibogaine had no significant effect on
      [35S]GTPgammaS binding over a similar concentration range. The efficacy of
      noribogaine as a full mu-opioid agonist may explain ibogaine's ability to block
      the acute signs of opiate withdrawal and its suppressive effects on morphine
      self-administration.

AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is a naturally-occurring indole compound that is being evaluated
      as a potential medication for substance use disorders. Although the precise
      mechanism of IBO action is unclear, recent in vitro data show this drug displays 
      properties similar to the noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist
      MK-801. The purpose of the present work was to compare In Vivo neurobiological
      effects of IBO and MK-801 in rats. Groups of male rats (n = 6-8/group) were
      decapitated 30 and 60 min after receiving intraperitoneal (i.p.) IBO (10 & 100
      mg/kg), MK-801 (0.1 & 1.0 mg/kg) or vehicle. Trunk blood was collected for the
      analysis of plasma prolactin and corticosterone; brains were harvested and
      dissected for determination of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their
      metabolites. Both IBO and MK-801 increased corticosterone secretion, but only IBO
      elevated plasma prolactin. IBO produced dramatic reductions in tissue DA levels
      with concurrent increases in the metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) 
      and homovanillic acid (HVA). This profile of IBO-induced changes in DA
      transmission was observed in the striatum, olfactory tubercle, and hypothalamus. 
      The effects of MK-801 on DA metabolism did not mimic IBO, as MK-801 tended to
      increase DA and its metabolites. Neither drug appreciably affected 5-HT systems. 
      Our results suggest that the effects of IBO on neuroendocrine function and DA
      transmission are not due to MK-801-like properties of IBO. Thus, the In Vivo
      mechanism of IBO action cannot be explained simply on the basis of antagonism at 
      NMDA receptors.

AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is a psychoactive indole alkaloid that has antiaddictive
      properties. However, treatment with IBO may lead to neurotoxicity, since IBO and 
      its metabolites interact persistently with many neurotransmitter systems. Here,
      we recorded cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from rats anesthetized
      with isoflurane. The heart rate (HR) was monitored via electrocardiogram (EKG)
      electrodes. After the baseline EEG was recorded, rats received one
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of 50 mg/kg IBO. EEG signals were recorded for 2 hr. 
      Rats were then sacrificed and brains dissected into frontal cortex (FC), caudate 
      nucleus (CN), hippocampus (HIP), and brain stem (BS). The level of dopamine (DA),
      serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites were determined by high-performance
      liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Compared with
      baseline, a decrease in HR immediately after IBO injection and a decrease in
      delta, theta, alpha, and beta power spectra frequency bands (1-4, 4-8, 8-13,
      13-32Hz) during the first 30 min after IBO administration was observed. EEG
      recovered within the next 15 min. In CN, the level of DA decreased and DA
      turnover rate increased significantly. The levels of 5-HT increased in FC. The
      pattern of EKG and EEG response to IBO may be due to multiple receptor
      interactions of IBO.

AB  - Ibogaine, an alkaloid extracted from Tabemanthe iboga, is being studied as a
      potential long-acting treatment for oploid and stimulant abuse as well as for
      alcoholism and smoking. Studies in this laboratory have used animal models to
      characterize ibogaine's interactions with drugs of abuse, and to investigate the 
      mechanisms responsible. Ibogaine, as well as its metabolite, noribogaine, can
      decrease both morphine and cocaine self-administration for several days in some
      rats; shorter-lasting effects appear to occur on ethanol and nicotine intake.
      Acutely, both ibogaine and noribogaine decrease extracellular levels of dopamine 
      in the nucleus accumbens of the rat brain. Ibogaine pretreatment (19 hours
      beforehand) blocks morphine-induced dopamine release and morphine-induced
      locomotor hyperactivity while, in contrast, it enhances similar effects of
      stimulants (cocaine and amphetamine). Ibogaine pretreatment also blocks
      nicotine-induced dopamine release. Both ibogaine and noribogaine bind to kappa
      opioid and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and to serotonin uptake sites;
      ibogaine also binds to sigma-2 and nicotinic receptors. The relative
      contributions of these actions are being assessed. Our ongoing studies in rats
      suggest that kappa agonist and NMDA antagonist actions contribute to ibogaine's
      effects on opioid and stimulant self-administration, while the serotonergic
      actions may be more important for ibogaine-induced decreases in alcohol intake. A
      nicotinic antagonist action may mediate ibogaine-induced reduction of nicotine
      preferences in rats. A sigma-2 action of ibogaine appears to mediate its
      neurotoxicity. Some effects of ibogaine (e.g., on morphine and cocaine
      self-administration, morphine-induced hyperactivity, cocaine-induced increases in
      nucleus accumbens dopamine) are mimicked by a kappa agonist (U50,488) and/or a
      NMDA antagonist (MK-801). Moreover, a combination of a kappa antagonist and a
      NMDA agonist will partially reverse several of ibogaine's effects. Ibogaine's
      long-term effects may be mediated by slow release from fat tissue (where ibogaine
      is sequestered) and conversion to noribogaine. Different receptors, or
      combinations of receptors, may mediate interactions of ibogaine with different
      drugs of abuse.

AB  - Although the alkaloid ibogaine is a potent hallucinogenic agent some indications 
      suggest that it may be useful for the treatment of opioid and cocaine addiction. 
      The neurochemical mechanism(s) underlying ibogaine effects remain unclear. In the
      present study we investigated the interaction of ibogaine with the phencyclidine 
      (PCP) site located in the ionophore of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      complex, with the NMDA receptor binding site, and with sigma binding sites. In
      well-washed membrane preparations of rat cortex and cerebellum, the PCP sites
      were labeled with [(3)H]MK-801 or [(3)H]1-[1(2-theinyl)-cyclohexyl]-piperidine
      ([(3)H]TCP), and the NMDA receptor with [(3)H]-CGP 39653. The sigma-1 and sigma-2
      binding site in rat cortex and cerebellum were labeled with [(3)H]pentazocine and
      [(3)H]1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine ([(3)H]DTG), respectively. Results indicated that 
      ibogaine interacts with high- and low-affinity PCP binding sites in the cortex:
      Ki(H) = 0.01-0.05 muM; Ki(L) = 2-4muM, and only with low-affinity sites in the
      cerebellum: Ki = 2-4, muM. In contrast, ibogaine (>100 muM) had no affinity for
      [(3)H]-CGP 39653 binding sites (cortex and cerebellum). The affinity of ibogaine 
      for sigma-1 and -2 binding sites in cortex and cerebellum ranged from 1.5-3muM.
      Since NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., MK-801) are thought to attenuate opioid
      withdrawal symptoms and cocaine sensitization, it is possible that binding of
      ibogaine to the PCP sites contributes to its potential 'endabuse' properties. In 
      turn, ibogaine interaction with sigma binding sites may be associated with its
      adverse effects.

AB  - Ibogaine may have antiaddiction potential against alcohol, psychostimulant and
      opiate abuse, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Ibogaine, however, has been
      demonstrated in numerous studies to have effects in multiple central nervous
      system (CNS) neurotransmitters systems. We are using in vitro and in vivo systems
      to study the effects of cocaine and whether these effects can be blocked by
      ibogaine. For the In Vivo studies, we first determined the acute and subacute
      effects of ibogaine (1-5.0 mg/kg) in mice using the plus-maze test. Acutely
      increasing doses of ibogaine produced a reduced aversion to the open arms. The
      subacute administration provoked a variable response which was characterized by
      fluctuations in aversive and antiaversive behavior of the animals to the open
      arms of the plus-maze during the 14-day treatment period. A separate group of
      mice received 1.0 mg/kg cocaine for 14 days, and upon abrupt cessation from
      cocaine treatment, ibogaine 2.5 mg/kg was administered to a subgroup of these
      mice. Ibogaine reversed the withdrawal aversions produced by the abrupt cessation
      from cocaine administration. For the in vitro studies, the expression and
      activity of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and Ca(2+) levels were examined
      following the incubation of PC 12 cells with cocaine. This is because PKC plays a
      key role in a number of cellular and neuronal functions. We report that cocaine
      disrupts signal transduction in PC 12 cells by altering the expression and
      activity of PKC isoforms and Ca(2+) levels. The data obtained suggest (1) that
      the PC 12 cells may be useful in studying the neurobiology of abused drugs, like 
      cocaine in vitro, (2) that if anxiety is a factor in drug dependency, then the
      antiaddictive property of ibogaine In Vivo may be associated with modifying the
      CNS neurotransmission that may be involved in anxiety. It remains to be
      determined whether the signaling involving PKC is important in the antiaddictive 
      properties of ibogaine.

AB  - The potential for deriving new psychotherapeutic medications from natural sources
      has led to renewed interest in rain forest plants as a source of lead compounds
      for the development of antiaddiction medications. Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid 
      found in the roots of Tabernanthe iboga (Apocynaceae family), a rain forest shrub
      that is native to equatorial Africa. Ibogaine is used by indigenous peoples in
      low doses to combat fatigue, hunger and in higher doses as a sacrament in
      religious rituals. Members of American and European addict self-help groups have 
      claimed that ibogaine promotes long-term drug abstinence from addictive
      substances, including psychostimulants and cocaine. Anecdotal reports attest that
      a single dose of ibogaine eliminates withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug
      cravings for extended periods of time. The purported antiaddictive properties of 
      ibogaine require rigorous validation in humans. We have initiated a rising
      tolerance study using single administration to assess the safety of ibogaine for 
      the treatment of cocaine dependency. The primary objectives of the study are to
      determine safety, pharmacokinetics and dose effects, and to identify relevant
      parameters of efficacy in cocaine-dependent patients. Pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic characteristics of ibogaine in humans are assessed by analyzing
      the concentration-time data of ibogaine and its desmethyl metabolite
      (noribogaine) from the Phase I trial, and by conducting in vitro experiments to
      elucidate the specific disposition processes involved in the metabolism of both
      parent drug and metabolite. The development of clinical safety studies of
      ibogaine in humans will help to determine whether there is a rationale for
      conducting efficacy trials in the future.

TI  - Modulation of the neuronal response to N-methyl-D-aspartate by selective sigma2
      ligands.
PG  - 62-71
AB  - It has now been accepted for several years that sigma (sigma) receptors exist in,
      at least, two distinct entities denoted sigma1 and sigma2. Previous
      electrophysiological studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that several
      selective sigma1 ligands potentiate the neuronal response to NMDA. The
      nonselective sigma1/sigma2 ligand DTG also potentiates the NMDA response.
      However, when DTG is administered at doses between 3 and 40 microg/kg, the
      increase of NMDA-induced activation turns to an epileptoid activity. Until
      recently, the physiological role of sigma2 receptors had been less studied due to
      the lack of selective sigma2 ligands. The goal of the present
      electrophysiological studies was to assess the effect of the intravenous
      administration of new selective sigma2 ligands on the neuronal response to NMDA
      in the CA3 region of the rat dorsal hippocampus. Lu 28-179 and BD 1008
      potentiated dose-dependently the NMDA response and generated bell-shaped
      dose-response curves. These ligands failed to generate any epileptoid activity on
      their own but the subsequent administration of a low dose of a sigma1 agonist
      (JO-1784) induced an epileptoid activity. Interestingly, the potentiations of the
      NMDA response induced by Lu 28-179 or BD 1008 were not reversed by haloperidol,
      by the neurosteroid progesterone, nor by the selective sigma1 antagonist NE-100. 
      Ibogaine, a high affinity sigma2 ligand, slightly increases the NMDA response,
      which was reversed by progesterone. These data suggest that, similarly to sigma1 
      ligands, sigma2 agonists potentiate the NMDA response and that the coactivation
      of sigma1 and sigma2 receptors could be necessary to induce an epileptoid
      activity. They also suggest that haloperidol may not act as a sigma2 antagonist
      and that several subtypes of sigma2 receptors could exist.

TI  - The effects of sigma, PCP, and opiate receptor ligands in rats trained with
      ibogaine as a discriminative stimulus.
PG  - 495-503
AB  - Although the mechanism of action of ibogaine, a hallucinogen that may be useful
      in the treatment of addiction, remains unknown, receptor binding studies suggest 
      that ibogaine produces its effects via interactions with multiple receptor types.
      In addition to serotonergic receptors, which have been studied previously with
      respect to ibogaine, likely candidates include opiate, sigma (sigma), and
      phencyclidine (PCP) binding sites. In an attempt to determine which of these
      receptor interactions are involved in the in vivo effects of ibogaine, ligands
      for sigma, PCP, and opiate receptors were assessed for their ability to
      substitute for or to antagonize the ibogaine-induced discriminative stimulus (10 
      mg/kg I.P., 60 min presession) in Fischer-344 rats. Intermediate levels of
      generalization were observed with the subtype nonselective sigma ligands
      3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)-piperidine [(+)-3-PPP] (69.0%) and
      1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine (DTG) (73.5%) but not with the sigma1-selective agents
      (+)-N-allylnormetazocine [(+)-SKF 10,047] and (+)-pentazocine. These findings,
      along with observations that ibogaine has appreciable affinity for sigma2
      receptors, suggest that these receptors may be involved in the ibogaine
      discriminative stimulus. With regard to opiate receptors, neither morphine, the
      prototypic mu agonist, nor kappa selective agonists (bremazocine,and U-50488)
      substituted for ibogaine. However, intermediate levels of generalization were
      observed with the mixed action opiates (-)-SKF 10,047 (78.9%), (+/-)-pentazocine 
      (73.9%), nalorphine (70.4%), and diprenorphine (75.0%) indicating a potential
      role for opiate receptors in the ibogaine stimulus. Partial substitution was also
      observed with naltrexone (55.6%) but not with naloxone or the selective kappa
      antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI). These agents were largely ineffective
      as antagonists of the ibogaine cue, although naloxone produced a moderate but
      statistically significant antagonism (69.8%). In addition, naloxone produced
      complete antagonism of the ibogaine-appropriate responding elicited by both
      (-)-SKF 10,047 (19.7%) and nalorphine (25.8%), whereas the ibogaine-appropriate
      responding produced by diprenorphine was only partially antagonized (44.4%). The 
      latter observations taken together with the finding that both nalorphine (>100
      microM) and diprenorphine (30 microM) have extremely low affinity for sigma2
      receptors, suggest that the ibogaine-appropriate responding produced by these
      agents is not mediated by sigma2 receptors. These findings imply that opiate
      effects may be involved in the ibogaine stimulus. In contrast to sigma2 and
      opiate receptors, ibogaine's reported interactions with NMDA receptors do not
      appear to be involved in its discriminative stimulus, as neither PCP nor MK-801
      produced a significant level of ibogaine-appropriate responding. Thus, the
      present study offers evidence that unlike NMDA receptors, both sigma2 and opiate 
      receptors may be involved in the ibogaine discriminative stimulus.

TI  - Behavioral and biochemical evidence for a nonessential 5-HT2A component of the
      ibogaine-induced discriminative stimulus.
PG  - 419-25
AB  - In the present investigation, the ability of two known hallucinogens, lysergic
      acid dimethylamide (LSD) and (-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine (DOM), to
      substitute for the ibogaine-induced discriminative stimulus (10 mg/kg I.P., 60
      min presession) was assessed in Fischer-344 rats. In these subjects, intermediate
      levels of generalization were observed to both agents (LSD, 63%; DOM, 66.4%).
      This intermediate generalization was completely blocked by pretreatment with the 
      5-HT2A antagonist pirenpirone, suggesting that the ibogaine-like effects of these
      agents are mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor. However, pirenpirone did not
      antagonize ibogaine itself, nor did it antagonize the ibogaine-like effects of
      harmaline and 12-hydroxyibogamine (noribogaine). To further evaluate the
      serotonergic properties of ibogaine, in vivo protection assays and in vitro
      binding assays were employed. Micromolar 5-HT2A affinity was observed with
      ibogaine (92.5 microM), 12-hydroxyibogamine (34.5 microM), and harmaline (42.5
      microM). Despite the apparently low affinity of these agents, both ibogaine and
      harmaline, but not 12-hydroxyibogamine, produced significant protection from
      receptor alkylation by N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) when
      given 60 min prior to this alkylating agent. The results of these studies suggest
      that although ibogaine may produce some of its effects via interactions with
      5-HT2A receptors, these do not appear to be essential to the ibogaine-induced
      discriminative stimulus.

TI  - Failure of ibogaine to produce phencyclidine-like discriminative stimulus effects

PG  - 413-8
AB  - The discriminative stimulus properties of ibogaine were investigated in rats
      trained to discriminate phencyclidine (PCP; 2.0 mg/kg, I.P.) from saline under a 
      two-lever fixed-ratio (FR) 32 schedule of food reinforcement. Ibogaine (5.6-17.6 
      mg/kg, I.P.) showed a complete lack of substitution. Ibogaine (0.5-4.0 mg/kg,
      I.M.) also failed to generalize in rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate PCP
      (0.1 mg/kg, I.M.) from sham injection. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), tested
      as a reference compound, produced partial substitution for PCP in rats and
      occasioned little responding on the PCP-associated lever in monkeys. These
      results demonstrate important differences between the behavioral effects of PCP
      and other types of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and ibogaine and do not
      support the hypothesis that the affinity of ibogaine for the PCP site on
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors plays a major role in its acute behavioral 
      effects.

PG  - 99-106
AB  - The neural basis of ibogaine's effects on drug-related behaviours is unclear. One
      possibility is that ibogaine interferes with the shared capacity of many
      addictive agents to stimulate brain dopamine activity, but reports of ibogaine
      effects on dopamine activity have been inconsistent. Our study suggests such
      inconsistencies may result from variations in prior drug exposure. If ibogaine
      blocks dopamine activity, then it should, like dopamine blockers, decrease
      preference for natural rewards such as sweet solutions. However, 40 mg/kg
      ibogaine i.p. did not decrease preference for a glucose + saccharin solution when
      it was administered to male Long Evans rats 24 h prior to test in Experiment 1.
      Nor did ibogaine attenuate conditioned preference for a neutral flavour
      previously paired with sweet taste in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, effects of
      40 mg/kg ibogaine on amphetamine-induced locomotion were investigated in
      drug-naive and drug-experienced (four prior doses of 1.5 mg/kg amphetamine) rats.
      Locomotion was significantly lower in those ibogaine-treated rats that had
      previously been exposed to amphetamine than in those that had not. Thus, ibogaine
      may serve to decrease induced levels of dopamine activity in drug-experienced
      animals or humans from elevated, sensitized levels back to baseline levels. This 
      could lead to a reduction of sensitized levels of drug craving in addiction.

TI  - Time-dependent interactions between iboga agents and cocaine.
PG  - 123-6
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of iboga agents on
      cocaine-induced hyperactivity. Both inhibition and enhancement of cocaine-induced
      activity by ibogaine have been reported. In the present study, rats were treated 
      with either ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.), noribogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.),
      18-methoxycoronaridine (40 mg/kg, i.p.), or saline, 1 or 19 h prior to the
      administration of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. Motor activity was
      monitored thereafter for 3 h. All three iboga agents had acute inhibitory effects
      and delayed potentiating effects on cocaine-induced hyperactivity. These
      time-dependent effects, which could not be attributed to the motor activity
      induced by the iboga agents alone, account for divergent results reported in the 
      literature.

TI  - Effects of noribogaine on the development of tolerance to antinociceptive action 
      of morphine in mice.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - The effects of noribogaine, a metabolite of ibogaine, on the development of
      tolerance to the antinociception action of morphine was determined in male
      Swiss-Webster mice. Ibogaine is an alkaloid isolated from the bark of the African
      shrub, Tabernanthe iboga. Morphine tolerance in mice was developed by two
      different methods. Mice were rendered tolerant to morphine either by subcutaneous
      implantation of a pellet containing 25 mg morphine free base for 4 days or by
      injecting morphine (20 mg/kg, s.c.) twice a day for 4 days. Placebo pellet
      implanted mice or vehicle injected mice served as controls. To determine the
      effect of intraperitoneally administered noribogaine on tolerance development,
      the drug was injected in the appropriate dose twice a day. In pellet implanted
      mice, a dose of 20 mg/kg of noribogaine attenuated the tolerance to morphine
      whereas lower doses had no effect. Similarly, in mice given multiple injections
      of morphine, noribogaine attenuated tolerance development at 20 and 40 mg/kg
      doses. Previous studies from this laboratory had shown that ibogaine at 40 and 80
      mg/kg doses inhibited tolerance to morphine. Because noribogaine could attenuate 
      morphine tolerance at lower doses than ibogaine, it is concluded that the
      attenuating effect of ibogaine on morphine tolerance may be mediated by its
      conversion to noribogaine, a more active metabolite.

TI  - Excitotoxic mechanisms of neurodegeneration in transmissible spongiform
      encephalopathies.
PG  - 194-205
AB  - Endogenous excitatory amino acids (EAAs) such as glutamic or aspartic acids have 
      been proposed to mediate the brain damage to EAA receptor-rich brain sites that
      is caused by a variety of external toxic agents (glutamic acid, domoic acid,
      kainic acid, ibogaine, trimethyltin (TMT), 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)), as
      well as from such naturally-occurring age-related neurodegenerative diseases as
      Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, and Parkinson's disease. Sites often
      damaged include the hypothalamus (glutamate), the hippocampal and neocortical
      pyramidal neurons (domoic acid), the cerebellar Purkinje neurons (ibogaine) and
      the corpus striatum (3-NPA, amphetamine). The excitotoxic damage occurs to
      neuronal cell bodies and their dendrites, resulting in a characteristics
      appearance of pyknotic neurons surrounded by their vacuolated, swollen dendrites.
      Axons passing through the region that lack EAA receptors are completely spared.
      However, astrocytes with swollen perikarya and nuclei (Alzheimer's type II
      "reactive" astrocytes) are often observed in the vicinity of the lesions. Animal 
      and human "Prion Diseases" or "Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies" (TSEs) 
      result (after a period of months to years) in a neurodegenerative picture
      characterized by pyknotic neurons surrounded by vacuoles with numerous reactive
      astrocytes in the vicinity of the damage. In addition, amyloid deposits composed 
      of a protease-resistant protein (PrPSc) characteristic of the particular host
      species with the disease are found near the degenerating neurons. By using
      different strains of the scrapies TSE agent to inoculate hamsters and mice,
      reproducible models of hypothalamic, hippocampal, or cerebellar damage resulting 
      in the appropriate functional deficits may be obtained. Because of the close
      similarity in the appearance, localization, and functional consequences from TSE 
      neuropathology compared to some of the well-known EAA syndromes, we propose that 
      excitotoxic mechanisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of TSE
      neurodegenerative diseases. The similarity in pathogenesis of the
      neurodegenerative processes in excitotoxicity compared to TSE diseases also
      implies that neuroprotective strategies against excitotoxicity may also be
      effective against TSEs.

TI  - Selective damage to the cerebellar vermis in chronic alcoholism: a contribution
      from neurotoxicology to an old problem of selective vulnerability.
PG  - 355-63
AB  - The curiously consistent localization of cerebellar cortical damage in chronic
      alcoholism is re-evaluated in the light of selective damage, with a similar
      topography in the cerebellar vermal region, in superficial siderosis in man and
      in experimental animals exposed to certain toxic substances. Attention is drawn
      to the capacity for Purkinje cell dendrites and Bergmann glia to extract
      materials from the CSF, and to the close anatomical relationships of the
      susceptible lobules I-II, IX and X to the roof of the IVth ventricle and to the
      cistern of the great cerebral veins. This restriction of damage to vermis and
      paravermis may reflect some compartmentalization of CSF flow within
      leptomeninges, consistently increasing exposure of these cerebellar surfaces to
      materials circulating in the CSF. In other circumstances when this pattern of
      damage is encountered it raises the question as to whether other environmental
      agents, gaining access to the CSF, may be similarly distributed.

TI  - The olivocerebellar projection mediates ibogaine-induced degeneration of Purkinje
      cells: a model of indirect, trans-synaptic excitotoxicity.
PG  - 8828-41
AB  - Ibogaine, an indole alkaloid that causes hallucinations, tremor, and ataxia,
      produces cerebellar neurotoxicity in rats, manifested by degeneration of Purkinje
      cells aligned in narrow parasagittal bands that are coextensive with activated
      glial cells. Harmaline, a closely related alkaloid that excites inferior olivary 
      neurons, causes the same pattern of Purkinje cell degeneration, providing a clue 
      to the mechanism of toxicity. We have proposed that ibogaine, like harmaline,
      excites neurons in the inferior olive, leading to sustained release of glutamate 
      at climbing fiber synapses on Purkinje cells. The objective of this study was to 
      test the hypothesis that increased climbing fiber activity induced by ibogaine
      mediates excitotoxic Purkinje cell degeneration. The inferior olive was
      pharmacologically ablated in rats by a neurotoxic drug regimen using
      3-acetylpyridine, and cerebellar damage attributed to subsequent administration
      of ibogaine was analyzed using immunocytochemical markers for neurons and glial
      cells. The results show that ibogaine administered after inferior olive ablation 
      produced little or no Purkinje cell degeneration or glial activation. That a
      lesion of the inferior olive almost completely prevents the neurotoxicity
      demonstrates that ibogaine is not directly toxic to Purkinje cells, but that the 
      toxicity is indirect and dependent on integrity of the olivocerebellar
      projection. We postulate that ibogaine-induced activation of inferior olivary
      neurons leads to release of glutamate simultaneously at hundreds of climbing
      fiber terminals distributed widely over the surface of each Purkinje cell. The
      unique circuitry of the olivocerebellar projection provides this system with
      maximum synaptic security, a feature that confers on Purkinje cells a high degree
      of vulnerability to excitotoxic injury.

TI  - Attenuation of alcohol consumption by a novel nontoxic ibogaine analogue
      (18-methoxycoronaridine) in alcohol-preferring rats.
PG  - 615-9
AB  - We previously reported that single administration of ibogaine, an indol alkaloid 
      with antiaddictive properties, dose dependently reduced alcohol intake in three
      strains of alcohol-preferring rats. The present study examined the effect of
      different doses of a newly developed nontoxic ibogaine analogue,
      18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), on alcohol intake. Selectively bred
      alcohol-preferring rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or
      5, 20 and 40 mg/kg of 18-MC at 9:30 AM, and their consumption of alcohol, water
      and food was measured for 24 h. Our results demonstrate that a single injection
      of 18-MC significantly and dose dependently attenuated alcohol consumption and
      preference and commensurately increased water intake. Only the highest dose of
      18-MC significantly decreased food intake. Although the true mechanism of action 
      of 18-MC in suppressing alcohol intake is not yet fully understood, it may, like 
      ibogaine, exert its attenuating effects on alcohol consumption by modulating
      neurotransmitters believed to be involved in the regulation of alcohol intake.

TI  - Effects of ibogaine on performance in the 8-arm radial maze.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - The effects of ibogaine were studied in 12 rats trained to perform in an 8-arm
      radial maze. In Phase I, the mean number of sessions to criterion and cumulative 
      errors to criterion, as well as mean response rate, were determined for two
      groups of six animals in a task where only four arms were baited. Group 1
      received a potentially neurotoxic dose of ibogaine (50 mg/kg IP administered
      twice, with approximately 8 h between injections), and group 2 received vehicle. 
      Both groups had similar levels of performance, but ibogaine-treated subjects had 
      a significantly lower rate of responding in the maze. During Phase II, subjects
      were given a range of doses of ibogaine 20 min prior to working in the maze.
      Ibogaine produced a dose-dependent decrease in response rate, but efficiency (%
      arms correct) was not affected. In Phase III, subjects were divided into the same
      groups as they had been in Phase I. Ibogaine (30 mg/kg, IP) or vehicle was
      administered immediately following daily sessions in the maze. Ibogaine-treated
      rats committed significantly fewer errors than those in the vehicle treated
      group. Thus, in the present study, ibogaine failed to produce any deleterious
      effects on either acquisition of a novel task or efficiency in a previously
      learned task.

TI  - Sex differences in ibogaine antagonism of morphine-induced locomotor activity and
      in ibogaine brain levels and metabolism.
PG  - 809-15
AB  - The present study demonstrates that the putative antiaddictive agent ibogaine
      produces more robust behavioral effects in female than in male rats and that
      these behavioral differences correlate with higher levels of ibogaine in the
      brain and plasma of female rats. There were no differences in basal locomotor
      activity between the sexes, and the response of rats to ibogaine differed between
      the sexes even in the absence of morphine. Five h after receiving ibogaine (40
      mg/kg, i.p.). antagonism of morphine-induced locomotor activity was evident in
      female but not in male rats. Either 19 h after administration of ibogaine (10-60 
      mg/kg, i.p.), or one h after administration of noribogaine (5-40 mg/kg, i.p.), a 
      suspected metabolite, antagonism of morphine was significantly greater in female 
      than in male rats. Brain and plasma levels of ibogaine (1 h) and noribogaine (5
      h), measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were greater in females as 
      compared with males receiving the same dose of ibogaine. Levels of both ibogaine 
      and noribogaine were substantially lower at 19 h than at earlier times after
      ibogaine administration, contrary to a previous study in humans. For both sexes, 
      subcutaneous administration of ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p., 19 h) produced greater
      antagonism of morphine-induced locomotor activity than did a comparable
      intraperitoneal injection, consistent with previous studies from this laboratory 
      demonstrating that the former route of administration produces higher levels of
      ibogaine in the brain. These data show that there are sex differences in the
      effects of ibogaine and that this may be due to decreased bioavailability of
      ibogaine in males as compared to females.

      Purkinje cells in male Fischer 344 rats. A behaviorally active dose of ibogaine
      (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to a group of six subjects every other day for 
      60 days while the control group received an equivalent volume of saline (1
      ml/kg). Estimates of Purkinje cell number were determined using the optical
      dissector/fractionator technique. No significant differences in Purkinje cell
      number were observed between the ibogaine (243764[+/-32766]) and control groups
      (230813[+/-16670]).

TI  - Assessment of neurotoxicity from potential medications for drug abuse: ibogaine
      testing and brain imaging.
PG  - 29-39; discussion 39-40
AB  - New technologies utilized for monitoring brain function can be more sensitive in 
      the assessment of desired or undesired pharmacological effects than can clinical 
      examination. Nonetheless, careful case-by-case analysis is required to determine 
      to what extent a change detected with a sensitive imaging modality will have
      clinical significance. Whereas in some instances the technology may suggest a
      subclinical condition years before clinical signs develop, in other instances
      changes seen may be compensated for through system reserves, redundancy, or
      plasticity. Furthermore, simultaneous application of several assay instruments,
      including behavioral, electrophysiological, and nuclear medicine approaches, may 
      be appropriate and useful for establishing correlations between changes in
      specific aspects of brain function and amelioration of a disease (drug abuse
      disorder) or its sequelae. In the example of ibogaine, a testing strategy was
      developed to assess human subjects for possible changes in cerebellar function
      (that were suggested by preclinical findings indicating subtle damage). Thus,
      subjects may be tested for subclinical alterations during and immediately
      following a clinical trial. This "harbinger of toxicity" approach would provide
      clinicians the critical data necessary for appropriate follow-up of subjects as
      well as the propriety of continuance of the clinical trials within the ibogaine
      project.

PG  - 119-22
AB  - The ability of ibogaine, injected 24 hr before amphetamine, to modify the
      establishment of amphetamine-induced place preference learning was assessed. A
      single injection of ibogaine blocked the establishment of amphetamine place
      preference after 1 or 2 conditioning trials, but it was less effective after 4
      trials. The reduced effectiveness of ibogaine across multiple conditioning trials
      appears to be the result of the development of tolerance to ibogaine.

      kappa- and delta-opioid receptor agonists, respectively, were determined in male 
      Swiss-Webster mice. Mice were rendered tolerant to opioid receptor agonists by
      injecting morphine (20 mg/kg, s.c.), U-50,488H (25 mg/kg, i.p.) or DPDPE (20
      microg/mouse, i.c.v.) twice a day for 4 days. Ibogaine (20, 40 or 80 mg/kg, i.p.)
      given twice a day for 4 days did not alter the tail-flick latency. Ibogaine (40
      or 80 mg/kg, i.p.) injected 10 min before each injection of morphine inhibited
      the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive action of morphine, however, 
      the lower dose of ibogaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was ineffective. Ibogaine (20, 40 or 
      80 mg/kg, i.p.) given prior to the injection of U-50,488H or DPDPE did not modify
      the development of tolerance to their antinociceptive action. It is concluded
      that ibogaine inhibits selectively the development of tolerance to the
      antinociceptive action of mu- but not kappa- or delta-opioid receptor agonists in
      mice.

AB  - Ibogaine, an alkaloid isolated from the bark of the African shrub, Tabernanthe
      iboga, has been claimed to decrease the self-administration of drugs of abuse
      like morphine, cocaine and alcohol. To determine whether these effects are
      mediated via opioid receptor systems, the effects of ibogaine and its metabolite,
      noribogaine on the antinociceptive actions of morphine, U-50,488H and
      [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) which are mu- kappa- and delta-opioid receptor 
      agonists, respectively, were determined in male Swiss-Webster mice.
      Administration of morphine (7 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.), U-50,488H (15 or 25 mg/kg,
      i.p.) or DPDPE (10 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) produced antinociception in mice as
      measured by the tail-flick test. Ibogaine (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg, i.p.) by itself
      did not alter the tail-flick latency. The same doses of ibogaine injected 10 min 
      before the opioid drugs did not modify the antinociceptive actions of morphine,
      U-50,488H or DPDPE. Ibogaine administered 4 h or 24 h prior to morphine injection
      did not modify the antinociceptive action of the latter. A dose of 40 mg/kg
      (i.p.) of noribogaine enhanced the antinociceptive activity of morphine (10
      mg/kg, s.c.). Similarly, the doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg of noribogaine enhanced the
      antinociception produced by a smaller dose of morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.). However, 
      antinociception induced by U-50,488H and DPDPE was not modified by noribogaine
      (10-40 mg/kg). It is concluded that ibogaine, which has been suggested to
      decrease the self-administration of cocaine and opiates like heroin in humans,
      does not produce such an action by interacting directly with multiple opioid
      receptors. However, the metabolite of ibogaine enhances the antinociception of
      morphine but not of U-50,488H or DPDPE. Thus, in vivo evidence has been provided 
      for the possible interaction of ibogaine with mu-opioid receptor following its
      metabolism to noribogaine.

TI  - Fluoro-Jade: a novel fluorochrome for the sensitive and reliable histochemical
      localization of neuronal degeneration.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - Fluoro-Jade is an anionic fluorochrome capable of selectively staining
      degenerating neurons in brain slices. The histochemical application of
      Fluoro-Jade results in a simple, sensitive and reliable method for staining
      degenerating neurons and their processes. The technique will detect neuronal
      degeneration resulting from exposure to a variety of neurotoxic insults.
      Fluoro-Jade can be combined with other fluorescent methodologies including
      immunofluorescence, fluorescent axonal tract tracing, and fluorescent Nissl
      counterstaining. Compared to conventional methodologies, Fluoro-Jade is a more
      sensitive and definitive marker of neuronal degeneration than hematoxylin and
      eosin (H&E) or Nissl type stains, while being comparably sensitive yet
      considerably simpler and more reliable than suppressed silver techniques.

TI  - Evidence for roles of kappa-opioid and NMDA receptors in the mechanism of action 
      of ibogaine.
PG  - 340-3
AB  - Ibogaine, a putatively anti-addictive alkaloid, binds to kappa-opioid and NMDA
      receptors. In the present study we investigated the roles of kappa-opioid and
      NMDA actions in mediating ibogaine's (40 mg/kg, i.p.) behavioral and
      neurochemical effects in rats. A combination of a kappa-opioid antagonist
      (norbinaltorphimine, 10 mg/kg, s.c.) and a NMDA agonist (NMDA, 20 mg/kg, i.p.)
      partially prevented ibogaine-induced inhibition of intravenous morphine
      self-administration and ibogaine-induced antagonism of morphine-induced locomotor
      stimulation. The combination, as well as norbinaltorphimine and NMDA alone,
      blocked the acute effects of ibogaine on dopamine release and metabolism in the
      striatum. The data suggest that both kappa-opioid agonist and NMDA antagonist
      actions of ibogaine contribute to its putative anti-addictive effects.

TI  - Ibogaine and the dopaminergic response to nicotine.
PG  - 249-56
AB  - There is increasing evidence that the rewarding effect of nicotine is mediated by
      the mesolimbic dopamine system. The first objective of this study was to examine 
      the dopamine response to repeated i.v. infusions of nicotine. Using in vivo
      microdialysis in awake and freely moving male Sprague-Dawley rats, we
      demonstrated that i.v. nicotine infusions (0.16 mg/kg or 0.32 mg/kg per infusion)
      produced increases in extracellular dopamine levels that were dose- and infusion 
      order-dependent. Acute tolerance was evidenced by the smaller dopamine response
      produced by a second infusion of nicotine, administered 1 h after the first one. 
      Tolerance was reversible, since the dopamine response to a second infusion of
      nicotine was unchanged when the interval between the infusions was increased to 3
      h. Ibogaine, an alkaloid found in Tabernanthe iboga, is claimed to decrease
      smoking and to have an anti-nicotinic action. The second objective of this study 
      was to establish whether this claim has any neurochemical basis. Pretreatment
      with ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) 19 h prior to the first nicotine infusion (0.32
      mg/kg per infusion) significantly attenuated the increase in extracellular
      dopamine levels induced by-the nicotine infusions, suggesting that ibogaine may
      decrease the rewarding effect of nicotine.

TI  - Ibogaine and a total alkaloidal extract of Voacanga africana modulate neuronal
      excitability and synaptic transmission in the rat parabrachial nucleus in vitro.
PG  - 603-10
AB  - Ibogaine is a natural alkaloid of Voacanga africana that is effective in the
      treatment of withdrawal symptoms and craving in drug addicts. As the synaptic and
      cellular basis of ibogaine's actions are not well understood, this study tested
      the hypothesis that ibogaine and Voacanga africana extract modulate neuronal
      excitability and synaptic transmission in the parabrachial nucleus using the
      nystatin perforated patch-recording technique. Ibogaine and Voacanga africana
      extract dose dependently, reversibly, and consistently attenuate evoked
      excitatory synaptic currents recorded in parabrachial neurons. The ED50 of
      ibogaine's effect is 5 microM, while that of Voacanga africana extract is 170
      micrograms/ml. At higher concentrations, ibogaine and Voacanga africana extract
      induce inward currents or depolarization that are accompanied by increases in
      evoked and spontaneous firing rate. The depolarization or inward current is also 
      accompanied by an increase in input resistance and reverses polarity around 0 mV.
      The depolarization and synaptic depression were blocked by the dopamine receptor 
      antagonist haloperidol. These results indicate that ibogaine and Voacanga
      africana extract 1) depolarize parabrachial neurons with increased excitability
      and firing rate; 2) depress non-NMDA receptor-mediated fast synaptic
      transmission; 3) involve dopamine receptor activation in their actions. These
      results further reveal that the Voacanga africana extract has one-hundredth the
      activity of ibogaine in depressing synaptic responses. Thus, ibogaine and
      Voacanga africana extract may produce their central effects by altering
      dopaminergic and glutamatergic processes.

PG  - PL147-53
AB  - In the present investigation, Fischer-344 rats were trained to discriminate 10.0 
      mg/kg of ibogaine from water using a pretreatment time of 60 minutes. Analysis of
      dose response data generated an ED50 of 4.6 mg/kg. The time course of the
      ibogaine (10.0 mg/kg) cue was also determined. The stimulus reached a maximum
      level of 94% ibogaine-appropriate responding at the 60-min pretreatment time.
      This was followed by a time-dependent decrease in ibogaine-appropriate
      responding. At a pretreatment time of 8 hrs only 6.4% drug-appropriate responding
      was observed. In substitution experiments, intermediate generalization was
      observed with a metabolite of ibogaine, 12-hydroxyibogamine [noribogaine] (71.6%)
      whereas complete generalization was seen with harmaline (83.5%).

TI  - Serotonergic mediation of fenfluramine discriminative stimuli in fawn-hooded
      rats.
PG  - PL83-90
AB  - Fenfluramine, a drug that induces increased synaptic serotonin, was used to train
      Fawn-Hooded rats in a drug discrimination paradigm. This strain of rats is
      thought to possess a genetic serotonin storage abnormality. The intent of the
      study was to see if the Fawn-Hooded rat was similar or dissimilar to the more
      frequently used strain of Sprague-Dawley rat in its ability to learn to
      discriminate 2.0 mg/kg fenfluramine administered intraperitoneally. In addition, 
      drugs presumed to work upon central serotonergic neurons were given to the
      fenfluramine-trained Fawn-Hooded rats to investigate if the cueing properties of 
      the training drug generalized to other agents. Results indicate that the
      Fawn-Hooded rats learn to discriminate fenfluramine from its vehicle at the same 
      rate, and with a similar sensitivity to lower doses, as do the Sprague-Dawley
      rats. Furthermore, fenfluramine was shown to completely generalize to MDMA (over 
      90%); TFMPP, m-CPP, quipazine and fluoxetine produced intermediate results (over 
      70%) and 5-MeODMT and ibogaine were vehicle-like (less than 70%). As these
      results coincide with those previously found in Sprague-Dawley rats, the
      conclusion is that the functional capacity to discriminate fenfluramine appears
      to be like that of other rat lines, and serotonergically-mediated, in the
      Fawn-Hooded rat. Suggestions to explain these results are offered and discussed.

TI  - Ibogaine: a potent noncompetitive blocker of ganglionic/neuronal nicotinic
      receptors.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - Ibogaine noncompetitively blocked (IC50 approximately 20 nM) 22NaCl influx
      through ganglionic-type nicotinic receptor channels of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 
      cells. The major metabolite O-des-methylibogaine was 75-fold less active, and
      O-t-butyl-O-des-methylibogaine was 20-fold less active. Ibogaine was relatively
      weak as a blocker (IC50 approximately 2000 nM) of the neuromuscular-type
      nicotinic receptor channels in human medulloblastoma TE671 cells. The blockade of
      nicotinic responses by ibogaine was only partially reversible in PC12 cells. In
      vivo, ibogaine at 10 mg/kg completely blocked epibatidine-elicited
      antinociception in mice, a response that is mediated by central nicotinic
      receptor channels. There was no significant blockade of the epibatidine response 
      at 24 hr after the administration of 40 mg/kg ibogaine. The blockade of nicotinic
      channels could contribute to the antiaddictive properties of ibogaine.

TI  - Ibogaine and cocaine abuse: pharmacological interactions at dopamine and
      serotonin receptors.
PG  - 161-8
AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid that has been of interest in recent years due to
      its putative efficacy in the treatment of drug dependence. For the most part,
      animal data have shown attenuation of some of the effects of stimulant drugs, for
      example, motor stimulation and self-administration. The mechanism of this
      inhibition of drug-induced behavior seems to suggest the action of the dopamine, 
      serotonin, NMDA, kappa, and/or sigma receptor sites, as indicated by the affinity
      of ibogaine to receptor selective ligands in binding competition studies.
      However, affinity for receptors does not in itself indicate their involvement. In
      vitro perfusion studies have proven a useful model to study the effect of
      ibogaine on neurotransmitter systems and the functional effects of such
      interactions. This review summarizes these data and the support of multiple
      effects of ibogaine, and the potential importance of its action on serotonergic
      modulation of dopamine release.

TI  - Ibogaine selectively inhibits nicotinic receptor-mediated catecholamine release.
PG  - R1-2
AB  - The effects of ibogaine, a putative anti-addictive drug, on stimulated
      catecholamine release were examined in cultured chromaffin cells to clarify its
      mechanism(s) of action. Low concentrations of ibogaine (1-10 microM) had a
      selective inhibitory action on nicotinic receptor-mediated catecholamine release,
      while higher concentrations (100 microM) inhibited additional modes of stimulated
      catecholamine release. These results suggest a selective inhibitory action of
      ibogaine at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, possibly at the receptor ion
      channel site.

TI  - Ibogaine and noribogaine potentiate the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity
      by opioid and 5-HT receptors.
PG  - 343-8
AB  - The effects of the putative anti-addictive compound ibogaine and its principal
      metabolite, noribogaine, on adenylyl cyclase activity were determined in various 
      areas of the rat brain. Neither compound altered either basal or
      forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities in the frontal cortex, midbrain 
      or striatum. However, in all three brain areas the addition of ibogaine and
      noribogaine significantly enhanced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by a
      maximally effective concentration of morphine. Similarly, both compounds also
      potentiated the inhibition of hippocampal adenylyl cyclase activity by a
      maximally effective concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Although
      ibogaine appears to be more potent than noribogaine in augmenting opioid- and
      5-HT-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, both compounds appear to
      be of comparable efficacy. Neither compound, however, modified the inhibitory
      action of the muscarinic acetylcholine agonist, carbachol, on adenylyl cyclase
      activity. The present data indicate that ibogaine and noribogaine cause a
      selective increase in receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. 
      This potentiation may be involved in the pharmacological actions of these
      compounds.

PG  - 258-62
AB  - The potential modulation of morphine antinociception by the putative
      anti-addictive agent ibogaine and its active metabolite (noribogaine) was
      investigated in rats with the radiant heat tail-flick test. Ibogaine pretreatment
      (40 mg/kg, i.p., 19 h) significantly decreased morphine (4 mg/kg, s.c.)
      antinociception, with no effects in the absence of morphine. However,
      co-administration of ibogaine (1-40 mg/kg, i.p.) and morphine (4 mg/kg, s.c.)
      exhibited a dose-dependent enhancement of morphine antinociception.
      Co-administration of noribogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and morphine also resulted in
      an increase in morphine antinociception, while noribogaine pretreatment (19 h)
      had no effect on morphine antinociception. The results show that ibogaine acutely
      potentiates morphine antinociception and that noribogaine could be the active
      metabolite responsible for this effect. However, the inhibitory effects of a 19 h
      ibogaine pretreatment, which resemble ibogaine-induced inhibition of morphine's
      stimulant properties, cannot be accounted for by noribogaine.

AB  - Acute administration of high doses of ibogaine (IBG) to the male rat results in
      degeneration of Purkinje cells and reactive gliosis in the cerebellar vermis. We 
      examined whether acute and chronic administration of IBG to male and female rats 
      results in gliosis as determined by quantification of the astroglial intermediate
      filament protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After acute
      administration of IBG, rats of both sexes showed dose-related increases in GFAP
      that were not confined to the cerebellar vermis. After chronic administration of 
      IBG, female, but not male rats, showed large (as much as 200% of control),
      dose-related increases in GFAP in hippocampus, olfactory bulbs, brain stem and
      striatum, but not cerebellum. In hippocampus, the cytoskeletal proteins,
      neurofilament 68 (NF-68) and beta-tubulin were increased in females treated
      chronically with IBG, findings consistent with a damage-induced sprouting
      response. Together, the data indicate that IBG damages areas of the brain outside
      the cerebellum and that the sites damaged are dependent on sex and dosage
      regimen.

TI  - Ibogaine neurotoxicity: a re-evaluation.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - Ibogaine is claimed to be an effective treatment for opiate and stimulant
      addiction. O'Hearn and Molliver, however, showed that ibogaine causes
      degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells in rats. The present study re-examined 
      cerebellar responses to the high doses of ibogaine used by O'Hearn and Molliver
      (100 mg/kg or 3 x 100 mg/kg) and sought to determine whether a lower dose (40
      mg/kg), one effective in reducing morphine and cocaine self-administration,
      produced similar responses. Purkinje cell degeneration was evaluated with a
      Fink-Heimer II stain, and enhanced glial cell activity with an antibody to glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein. Every rat treated with the high dose of ibogaine
      displayed clear evidence of Purkinje cell degeneration. The degeneration
      consistently occurred in the intermediate and lateral cerebellum, as well as the 
      vermis. Purkinje cells in lobules 5 and 6 were particularly susceptible. Given
      the response properties of cells in these lobules, this finding suggests any
      long-term motor deficits produced by ibogaine-induced degeneration should
      preferentially affect the head and upper extremity. In marked contrast, rats
      given the smaller dose of ibogaine displayed no degeneration above the level seen
      in saline-treated animals. When combined with information on other compounds,
      these data suggest that the degenerative and "anti-addictive' properties of
      ibogaine reflect different actions of the drug.

TI  - Neuroendocrine and neurochemical effects of acute ibogaine administration: a time
      course evaluation.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - Ibogaine (IBO) is an indole alkaloid that is reported to facilitate drug
      abstinence in substance abusers. Despite considerable investigation, the
      mechanism of IBO action in vivo and its suitability as a treatment for drug
      addiction remains unclear. The present study was designed to evaluate the
      time-course effects of acute IBO on neuroendocrine and neurochemical indices.
      Adult male rats were treated with i.p. saline or 50 mg/kg IBO and sacrificed 15, 
      30, 60, 120 min and 24 h later. Trunk blood was collected for hormone measures
      and brains were dissected for neurochemical analyses. IBO produced a rapid
      elevation in plasma prolactin that declined to control levels by 60 min.
      Corticosterone levels increased 15 min after drug administration, continued to
      increase for 120 min, but returned to control levels 24 h after dosing. IBO
      decreased dopamine (DA) concentrations in the striatum and frontal cortex at 30, 
      60 and 120 min after injection while DA metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
      acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), were elevated over the same time
      period. 24 h after IBO, DOPAC concentrations in striatum and HVA levels in the
      frontal cortex were below control values. Serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite
      5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) were decreased at 60 min after IBO
      administration only in the striatum. These data indicate that a single injection 
      of IBO produces a spectrum of effects that includes: (1) elevation of plasma
      prolactin and corticosterone, (2) short- and long-term effects on DA
      neurotransmission, and (3) modest, transient effects of 5-HT neurotransmission.
      The effects of IBO reported herein may have relevance to the anti-addictive
      properties of this drug, and this proposal warrants further investigation.

TI  - Pharmacological screen for activities of 12-hydroxyibogamine: a primary
      metabolite of the indole alkaloid ibogaine.
PG  - 10-8
AB  - The purported efficacy of ibogaine for the treatment of drug dependence may be
      due in part to an active metabolite. Ibogaine undergoes first pass metabolism and
      is O-demethylated to 12-hydroxyibogamine (12-OH ibogamine). Radioligand binding
      assays were conducted to identify the potency and selectivity profiles for
      ibogaine and 12-OH ibogamine. A comparison of 12-OH ibogamine to the primary
      molecular targets identified previously for ibogaine demonstrates that the
      metabolite has a binding profile that is similar, but not identical to the parent
      drug. Both ibogaine and 12-OH ibogamine demonstrated the highest potency values
      at the cocaine recognition site on the 5-HT transporter. The same rank order
      (12-OH ibogamine > ibogaine), but lower potencies were observed for the
      [3H]paroxetine binding sites on the 5-HT transporter. Ibogaine and 12-OH
      ibogamine were equipotent at vesicular monoamine and dopamine transporters. The
      metabolite demonstrated higher affinity at the kappa-1 receptor and lower
      affinity at the NMDA receptor complex compared to the parent drug. Quantitation
      of the regional brain levels of ibogaine and 12-OH ibogamine demonstrated
      micromolar concentrations of both the parent drug and metabolite in rat brain.
      Drug dependence results from distinct, but inter-related neurochemical
      adaptations, which underlie tolerance, sensitization and withdrawal. Ibogaine's
      ability to alter drug-seeking behavior may be due to combined actions of the
      parent drug and metabolite at key pharmacological targets that modulate the
      activity of drug reward circuits.

PG  - 226-9
AB  - The effects of the antiaddictive compound, ibogaine, and its primary metabolite, 
      noribogaine (12-hydroxyibogamine), on phosphoinositide hydrolysis were
      investigated. Although ibogaine did not alter phosphoinositide turnover in either
      striatal or hippocampal slices, noribogaine elicited a concentration-dependent
      increase in the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates. This stimulation was not
      altered by inclusion of tetrodotoxin, cadmium or omega-conotoxin indicating that 
      the increased production of [3H]inositol phosphates was not secondary to a
      release of one or more neurotransmitters. The present study indicates a
      stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by noribogaine may be involved in the 
      behavioral effects of ibogaine.

TI  - Structurally modified ibogaine analogs exhibit differing affinities for NMDA
      receptors.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - Based on both preclinical findings and anecdotal evidence in man, the
      psychoactive indole alkaloid ibogaine has been suggested to have anti-addictive
      properties. Previous studies indicate that blockade of NMDA receptors may mediate
      at least some of the putative anti-addictive actions of ibogaine. The potencies
      of a series of ibogaine analogs to inhibit
      (+)-[3-3H]5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10- imine
      ([3H]MK-801) binding to NMDA receptors were examined. This series of analogs
      included the putative ibogaine metabolite O-desmethylibogaine, its metabolism
      resistant analog O-t-butyl-O-desmethylibogaine, the iboga alkaloids
      (+/-)-ibogamine, (+/-)-coronaridine, tabernanthine, harmaline, and the
      indolotropanes endo-3-(1-methylindol-2-yl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]loctane
      (RS 075194-190), exo-3-(1-methylindol-2-yl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane
      (RS 075237-190), and endo-3-(indol-2-yl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane (RS
      025989-190). Among these compounds, ibogaine was the most potent inhibitor of
      [3H]MK-801 binding (Ki = approximately 1.2 microM), whilst the compounds with the
      greatest structural similarity to ibogaine, O-desmethylibogaine and
      O-t-butyl-O-desmethylibogaine were less potent (Ki = approximately 5.5 and 179.0 
      microL, respectively). In morphine-dependent mice, ibogaine, but not
      O-desmethylibogaine or O-t-butyl-O-desmethylibogaine, attenuated naloxone
      precipitated withdrawal jumping. These findings are consistent with the
      hypothesis that inhibition of the expression of morphine dependence by ibogaine
      is related to its NMDA receptor antagonist properties.

TI  - Ibogaine fails to interrupt the expression of a previously established one-trial 
      morphine place preference.
PG  - 857-72
AB  - 1. Ibogaine, a proposed anti-addictive agent, has been found to interfere with
      the acquisition of a weak morphine-induced place preference. The present series
      of experiments determined if ibogaine would interfere with the expression of a
      previously established morphine (5 mg/kg) place preference. 2. A single injection
      of 40 mg/kg of ibogaine 24 h, 12 h or 4 h prior to the preference test
      (Experiment 1) or 80 mg/kg of ibogaine 24 hr prior to the preference test
      (Experiment 3) did not interfere with the expression of a morphine conditioned
      place preference. 3. Furthermore, two injections of 40 mg/kg of ibogaine 48 h and
      24 h or 24 h and 4 h prior to testing (Experiment 2) did not interfere with the
      expression of a morphine place preference. 4. Ibogaine appears to be incapable of
      attenuating the expression of a previously established one-trial morphine place
      preference.

TI  - 18-Methoxycoronaridine, a non-toxic iboga alkaloid congener: effects on morphine 
      and cocaine self-administration and on mesolimbic dopamine release in rats.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - Ibogaine, a naturally occurring iboga alkaloid, has been claimed to be effective 
      in treating addiction to opioids and stimulants, and has been reported to inhibit
      morphine and cocaine self-administration in rats. However, ibogaine also has
      acute nonspecific side effects (e.g. tremors, decreased motivated behavior in
      general) as well as neurotoxic effects (Purkinje cell loss) manifested in the
      vermis of the cerebellum. 18-Methoxycoronaridine (MC) is a novel, synthetic iboga
      alkaloid congener that mimics ibogaine's effects on drug self-administration
      without appearing to have ibogaine's other adverse effects. Acutely, in rats, MC 
      decreased morphine and cocaine self-administration but did not affect bar-press
      responding for water. In some rats, treatment with MC (40 mg/kg) induced
      prolonged decreases in morphine or cocaine intake lasting several days or weeks. 
      MC had no apparent tremorigenic effect, and there was no evidence of cerebellar
      toxicity after a high dose (100 mg/kg) of MC. Similar to the effects of ibogaine 
      and other iboga alkaloids that inhibit drug self-administration, MC (40 mg/kg)
      decreased extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. MC therefore
      appears to be a safer, ibogaine-like agent that might be useful in the treatment 
      of addictive disorders.

TI  - Effect of ibogaine on cocaine-induced efflux of [3H] dopamine and [3H] serotonin 
      from mouse striatum.
PG  - 863-9
AB  - Ibogaine, an indole alkaloid with proposed antiaddictive properties, has
      structural similarity to serotonin and has been shown to have affinity to the
      kappa-opioid binding site. In addition to the dopamine system, the serotonin
      system is a major target for cocaine action and the opioid system can affect the 
      serotonin system. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of ibogaine on
      cocaine-induced, electrically evoked efflux of [3H]dopamine and [3H]serotonin
      from striatal tissue incubated in vitro, and their modulation by the kappa-opioid
      system. Cocaine (10(-6) M) added in vitro increased tthe fractional efflux of
      both [3H]dopamine (FRS2/FRS1 = 2.42 +/- 0.36) and [3H]serotonin (FRS2/FRS1 = 1.31
      +/- 0.06). Mice treated in vivo with ibogaine (40 mg/kg or 2 times 40 mg/kg, IP) 
      and killed 2 or 18 h later still showed the cocaine-induced increase in
      [3H]dopamine, but [3H]serotonin efflux was not increased. The 5-HTIB agonist
      CGS-12066A (10(-6) M, added in vitro) increased [3H]dopamine release, but did not
      alter cocaine-induced efflux of [3H]dopamine. CGS-12066A did not affect
      [3H]serotonin release, but the cocaine-induced increase in [3H]serotonin was
      inhibited. CGS-12066A (1 mg/kg, SC) potentiated cocaine (25 mg/kg, SC)-induced
      locomotor activity. Ibogaine pretreatment reduced both the cocaine and the
      CGS-12066A cocaine-induced increase in locomotor activity. The kappa-opioid
      agonist U-62066 (10(-6) M, added in vitro) reduced both [3H] dopamine and
      [3H]serotonin release. This inhibitory effect was blocked by in vivo
      administration ibogaine. U-62066 did not alter cocaine-induced [3H]dopamine
      efflux, but reduced cocaine-induced [3H]serotonin efflux. In striatal tissue from
      ibogaine-pretreated mice, U-62066 restored the cocaine-induced increase in
      [3H]serotonin release. U-62066 (1 mg/kg, SC) potentiated cocaine-induced behavior
      and maintained an increased locomotor activity after ibogaine treatment. The
      results suggest that ibogaine may block the cocainemediated effects on
      serotonergic transmission, that subsequently modulate dopamine release. The
      kappa-opioid modulation of serotonergic transmission is also involved.

TI  - Ibogaine block of the NMDA receptor: in vitro and in vivo studies.
PG  - 423-31
AB  - Ibogaine is an hallucinogenic indole alkaloid claimed to have anti-addictive
      properties. Although its mechanism of action is unknown, binding studies have
      indicated that the drug may interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. 
      We further investigated the nature of the interaction between ibogaine and NMDA
      receptors in voltage clamp and binding studies, and sought to confirm that the
      drug has NMDA receptor blocking activity in vivo. In whole-cell recordings from
      cultured rat hippocampal neurons, ibogaine caused a slow, concentration-dependent
      block of NMDA-induced currents (IC50, 3.1 microM at -60 mV). In contrast,
      ibogaine failed to affect either kainate- or gamma-aminobutyric acid-evoked
      currents. The blockade of NMDA currents was use- and voltage-dependent, and the
      long lasting ibogaine block could be occluded by co-application of Mg2+. Ibogaine
      also inhibited equilibrium [3H]dizocilpine binding to NMDA receptors in rat
      forebrain membranes (IC50, 3.2 microM). We conclude that ibogaine is an open
      channel NMDA receptor antagonist. Administration of ibogaine to mice resulted in 
      complete protection in the maximal electroshock test (ED50, 31 mg/kg, i.p.) and
      partial protection against NMDA-induced lethality, confirming that ibogaine can
      block NMDA receptors in vivo.

TI  - Ibogaine-like effects of noribogaine in rats.
PG  - 294-7
AB  - Ibogaine is a naturally occurring alkaloid that has been claimed to be effective 
      in treating addiction to opioids and stimulants; a single dose is claimed to be
      effective for 6 months. Analogously, studies in rats have demonstrated prolonged 
      (one or more days) effects of ibogaine on morphine and cocaine
      self-administration even though ibogaine is mostly eliminated from the body in
      several hours. These observations have suggested that a metabolite may mediate
      some of the effects of ibogaine. Recently, noribogaine was identified as a
      metabolite of ibogaine. Accordingly, the present study sought to determine, in
      rats, whether noribogaine had pharmacological effects mimicking those of
      ibogaine. Noribogaine (40 mg/kg) was found to decrease morphine and cocaine
      self-administration, reduce the locomotor stimulant effect of morphine, and
      decrease extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and striatum. 
      All of these effects were similar to effects previously observed with ibogaine
      (40 mg/kg); however, noribogaine did not induce any ibogaine-like tremors. The
      results suggest that noribogaine may be a mediator of ibogaine's putative
      anti-addictive effects.

      mass spectrometry.
PG  - 101-9
AB  - Ibogaine is naturally occurring indole alkaloid that is currently being
      considered as a treatment medication for drug dependence. Although there have
      been a variety of investigations regarding the mechanisms of action and
      pharmacology of ibogaine, relatively little has been reported regarding
      quantitative methods. Because of the paucity of analytical methodologies, studies
      involving the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ibogaine have also been limited.
      A method is described for the determination of ibogaine levels in plasma by gas
      chromatography -- methane chemical ionization mass spectrometry. [13C2H3]Ibogaine
      was synthesized and used as an internal standard to control for recovery during
      sample preparation. The assay requires one ml of plasma and is shown to be a
      selective and sensitive means of ibogaine quantitation.

      the animals following the administration of ibogaine (40 mg kg-1, i.p.). However,
      ibogaine, administered 22 h earlier, significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated the
      increase in dopamine overflow but not the hyperlocomotion, evoked by nicotine. 3.
      In the elevated plus-maze test, significant reductions in the open:total runway
      entries in both saline-treated controls (P < 0.05) and nicotine-treated (P <
      0.01) rats were obtained when the animals were tested 22 h after pretreatment
      with ibogaine (40 mg kg-1, i.p.). The total activity was significantly (P < 0.01)
      greater in the nicotine-treated rats but this response was not affected by
      ibogaine pretreatment. 4. Administration of ibogaine was associated with
      reductions in the tissue levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the NAc
      (P < 0.01) and striatum (P < 0.05) and an increase in the level of this
      metabolite in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (P < 0.01) while the levels of 
      dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the mPFC were reduced (P < 0.05). The 
      DOPAC/dopamine (P < 0.05) and 5-HIAA/5-HT (P < 0.01) ratios were significantly
      increased in the mPFC for at least 7 days after a single treatment with ibogaine.
      5. Ibogaine attenuates the nicotine-induced increases in dopamine overflow in the
      NAc and may, therefore, inhibit the rewarding effects of this drug. However, the 
      long lasting anxiogenesis induced by ibogaine warrant further investigation
      before its use could be recommended for smokers.

AB  - The present study examines the effect of prior morphine exposure on ibogaine
      antagonism of morphine-induced dopamine release. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      pretreated once a day for 2 days with morphine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline and
      given a low dose of ibogaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline 5 hr after the last
      morphine or saline injection. Nineteen hours later, rats (awake and freely
      moving) were challenged with morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.), and dopamine and its
      metabolites were monitored in the striatum and nucleus accumbens using in vivo
      microdialysis. Neither saline pretreatment, morphine pretreatment, nor ibogaine
      alone altered morphine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine and dopamine
      metabolites in either structure. However, when morphine pretreatment was combined
      with ibogaine, the morphine-induced elevation of dopamine, but not of
      metabolites, was completely blocked. These data suggest that prior morphine
      exposure enhances an opioid antagonist action of ibogaine on dopaminergic systems
      and that prior drug exposure may be a clinically significant determinant of
      ibogaine efficacy and/or potency in the treatment of opioid addiction.

TI  - Neuropharmacological characterization of local ibogaine effects on dopamine
      release.
PG  - 967-85
AB  - Local perfusion with ibogaine (10(-6) M-10(-3) M) via microdialysis probes in the
      nucleus accumbens or striatum of rats produced a biphasic dose-response effect on
      extracellular dopamine levels. Lower doses (10(-6) M-10(-4) M) produced a
      decrease while higher doses (5 x 10(-4) M-10(-3) M) produced an increase in
      dopamine levels. Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels were not effected.
      Naloxone (10(-6) M) and norbinaltorphimine (10(-6) M-10(-5) M) did not affect
      dopamine levels, but when co-administered with ibogaine (10(-4) M) blocked the
      decrease in dopamine levels produced by ibogaine. Ibogaine (10(-3) M) stimulation
      of dopamine levels in the striatum was calcium independent and not blocked by
      tetrodotoxin (10(-5) M). Pretreatment with cocaine (15 mg/kg), reserpine (5
      mg/kg) or alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (250 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally
      significantly reduced ibogaine (10(-3)M) stimulation of striatal dopamine levels.
      In striatal synaptosomes, both ibogaine and harmaline (10(-7)-10(-4) M) produced 
      dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]-dopamine uptake. These findings suggest that
      ibogaine has both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on dopamine release at the
      level of the nerve terminal. It is suggested that the inhibitory effect is
      mediated by kappa opiate receptors while the stimulatory effect is mediated by
      interaction with the dopamine uptake transporter.

TI  - Facilitation of memory retrieval by the "anti-addictive" alkaloid, ibogaine.
PG  - PL379-85
AB  - Anecdotal observations in humans indicate that indole alkaloid ibogaine may have 
      anti-addictive properties. It has been suggested that the therapeutic action of
      ibogaine may depend upon facilitated access to the past experiences, purportedly 
      influencing the initiation of drug addiction. To determine if ibogaine may
      facilitate memory retrieval, rats were trained in the Morris maze spatial
      navigation task. It has been found that ibogaine (0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg) or
      O-desmethyl-ibogaine (2.5 mg/kg) but not t-Butyl ibogaine, administered just
      before the test trial, facilitated spatial memory retrieval compared to rats
      receiving placebo treatment. It is concluded that although previously described
      NMDA receptor antagonistic properties of ibogaine may represent a locus for at
      least some of its actions, other mechanisms, involving facilitation of memory
      retrieval may be of importance for its anti-addictive effects.

TI  - Effects of ibogaine, and cocaine and morphine after ibogaine, on ventral
      tegmental dopamine neurons.
PG  - PL199-205
AB  - Ibogaine, an indole containing alkaloid, has been shown to reduce the rate of
      injection of morphine and cocaine in self-administration protocols. Since
      morphine- and cocaine-induced modulation of dopamine release is impulse dependent
      and essential for their reinforcing effects, disruption of dopamine neuronal
      activity by ibogaine could explain its purported 'antiaddictive' properties.
      Therefore, the present study was designed to determine: (1) the acute effects of 
      ibogaine on the activity of VTA dopamine neurons, and (2) whether ibogaine
      pretreatment causes a persistent modification of the dopamine neuronal response
      to morphine and cocaine. Extracellular recordings in anesthetized animals found
      that intravenous ibogaine markedly excited VTA dopamine neuronal firing. However,
      ibogaine pretreatment (6-8 hr and 19 hr before) failed to alter either the
      spontaneous activity of VTA neurons, or the response of these dopamine neurons to
      morphine or cocaine. Thus, ibogaine's excitatory effect on VTA neurons is not
      long-lasting nor does it persistently alter cocaine- or morphine-induced changes 
      in dopamine neuron impulse activity. Therefore, other mechanisms must be explored
      to account for the proposed antiaddictive properties of ibogaine.

TI  - The effect of ibogaine on Sigma- and NMDA-receptor-mediated release of
      [3H]dopamine.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - The indole alkaloid ibogaine has been suggested to have potential for inhibiting 
      dependency on stimulant drugs. Radioligand binding studies have suggested
      possible multisite actions of ibogaine: affinity at the kappa-opioid, NMDA, and
      sigma receptors, with effects on dopamine (DA) release. To further investigate
      the multiplicity of sites of action of ibogaine and the presynaptic regulation of
      the DA release, the effect of ibogaine on NMDA- and sigma-receptor-mediated
      efflux of [3H]DA was measured in striatal tissue from C57BL/6By mice. Striatal
      tissue was incubated in vitro with [3H]DA and the effect on DA release was
      measured. Both NMDA (25 microM) alone increased the efflux of DA.
      (+/)-Pentazocine (100 nM) did not inhibit the NMDA-evoked release. MK-801 (5
      microM) completely inhibited the NMDA-evoked release and inhibited the
      (+/-)-pentazocine-evoked release by 49%. Ibogaine (10 microM) itself increased
      the efflux of DA; at 1 microM it was without effect. Ibogaine (1 microM)
      inhibited the NMDA-evoked release of DA by 31% and inhibited the
      (+/-)-pentazocine-evoked release by 48%. In addition, the level of basal release 
      of DA obtained after the NMDA- or (+/)-pentazocine-evoked-release remained higher
      in the tissue exposed to ibogaine throughout. The results suggest that sigma
      receptors can regulate the release of DA, along with an action at the NMDA
      receptor. We previously reported action of ibogaine at the kappa-opioid site. The
      elevated basal release of DA in the presence of ibogaine after NMDA- or
      (+/-)-pentazocine-evoked release may reflect the ibogaine-induced removal of the 
      tonically active kappa-opioid system that acts presynaptically to reduce dopamine
      release. The kappa-opioid system also appears to be inhibitory on both the NMDA
      and sigma receptors.

AB  - The distribution of the putative anti-addictive substance ibogaine was measured
      in plasma, brain, kidney, liver and fat after ip and sc administration in rats.
      One hr after ip dosing (40 mg/kg), drug levels ranged from 106 ng/ml (plasma) to 
      11,308 ng/g (fat), with significantly higher values after sc administration of
      the same dose. Drug levels were 10-20 fold lower 12 hr after the same dose. These
      results suggest that: 1) ibogaine is subject to a substantial "first pass" effect
      after ip dosing, demonstrated by higher drug levels following the sc route, 2)
      ibogaine shows a large accumulation in adipose tissue, consistent with its
      lipophilic nature, and 3) persistence of the drug in fat may contribute to a long
      duration of action.

TI  - Discriminative stimulus effects of R-(+)-3-amino-1-hydroxypyrrolid-2-one,
      [(+)-HA-966], a partial agonist of the strychnine-insensitive modulatory site of 
      the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
PG  - 1267-73
AB  - The strychnine-insensitive glycine site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor complex is a target for development of a host of therapeutic agents
      including anxiolytics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, anti-ischemics and
      cognitive enhancers. In the present experiments, the discriminative stimulus
      effects of (+)-HA-966 [R-(+)-3-amino-1-hydroxypyrrolid-2-one], a low-efficacy
      partial agonist of the glycine site, was explored. Male, Swiss-Webster mice were 
      trained to discriminate (+)-HA-966 (170 mg/kg i.p.) from saline in a T-maze under
      which behavior was controlled by food. Other glycine partial agonists,
      1-amino-1-cyclopropanecarboxilic acid and D-cycloserine, fully substituted for
      the discriminative stimulus effects of (+)-HA-966 despite known differences in
      other pharmacological effects of these compounds. The glycine site antagonist,
      7-chlorkynurenic acid, did not substitute for (+)-HA-966. Likewise other
      functional NMDA antagonists acting at nonglycine sites of the NMDA receptor also 
      did not substitute: neither the high (dizocilpine) or low affinity (ibogaine)
      ion-channel blocker, the competitive antagonist, NPC 17742
      [2R,4R,5S-2-amino-4,5-(1, 2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid], nor the
      polyamine antagonist, ifenprodil, substituted for (+)-HA-966. Although the full
      agonist, glycine, did not substitute, this compound fully blocked the
      discriminative stimulus effects of (+)-HA-966. In a separate group of mice
      trained to discriminate 0.17 mg/kg of dizocilpine from saline, (+)-HA-966
      produced a maximum of only 50% dizoclipine-appropriate responses. These data
      suggest that the discriminative stimulus effects of (+)-HA-966 are based upon its
      partial agonist actions at the strychnine-insensitive glycine site.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Attenuation of alcohol intake by ibogaine in three strains of alcohol-preferring 
      rats.
PG  - 615-20
AB  - Alcohol-preferring (P), Fawn-Hooded (FH) and alcohol-accepting (AA) rats were
      injected intraperitoneally (IP) or subcutaneously (SC) with different doses (10, 
      30, and 60 mg/kg) of Ibogaine or vehicle. In a separate experiment, FH rats were 
      administered intragastrically (IG) with either 60 mg/kg of Ibogaine or vehicle
      for 5 days. In addition, the effects of Ibogaine on blood alcohol concentrations 
      were measured. Our data show that, contrary to the SC administration of Ibogaine,
      IP administration of the agent significantly and dose-dependently reduced alcohol
      intake in these rats. Subchronic IG administration of 60 mg/kg of Ibogaine into
      FH rats significantly reduced alcohol intake without the development of tolerance
      or a significant effect on food or water intake. A single IP injection of 60
      mg/kg Ibogaine into FH rats did not affect the blood alcohol levels. These
      results show that Ibogaine when injected IP or IG, but not SC, can significantly 
      reduce alcohol intake without an effect on blood alcohol concentrations or food
      intake. These findings may suggest the involvement of Ibogaine's metabolite(s) in
      reducing alcohol intake. Although the neuronal mechanism(s) of action of Ibogaine
      on the regulation of alcohol intake is not fully understood, it is speculated
      that Ibogaine or its metabolite(s) exerts its attenuating effect on alcohol
      intake by modulating neurotransmitters/neuromodulators proposed to be involved in
      regulation of alcohol consumption.

TI  - NMDA antagonist properties of the putative antiaddictive drug, ibogaine.
PG  - 753-60
AB  - Both anecdotal reports in humans and preclinical studies indicate that ibogaine
      interrupts addiction to a variety of abused substances including alcohol,
      opiates, nicotine and stimulants. Based on the similarity of these therapeutic
      claims to recent preclinical studies demonstrating that N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) antagonists attenuate addiction-related phenomena, we examined the NMDA
      antagonist properties of ibogaine. Pharmacologically relevant concentrations of
      ibogaine produce a voltage-dependent block of NMDA receptors in hippocampal
      cultures (Ki, 2.3 microM at -60 mV). Consistent with this observation, ibogaine
      competitively inhibits [3H]1-[1-(2-thienyl)-cyclohexyl]piperidine binding to rat 
      forebrain homogenates (Ki, 1.5 microM) and blocks glutamate-induced cell death in
      neuronal cultures (IC50, 4.5 microM). Moreover, at doses previously reported to
      interfere with drug-seeking behaviors, ibogaine substitutes as a discriminative
      stimulus (ED50, 64.9 mg/kg) in mice trained to discriminate the prototypic
      voltage-dependent NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine (0.17 mg/kg), from saline.
      Consistent with previous reports, ibogaine reduced naloxone-precipitated jumping 
      in morphine-dependent mice (ED50, 72 mg/kg). Although pretreatment with glycine
      did not affect naloxone-precipitated jumping in morphine-dependent mice, it
      abolished the ability of ibogaine to block naloxone-precipitated jumping. Taken
      together, these findings link the NMDA antagonist actions of ibogaine to a
      putative "antiaddictive" property of this alkaloid, its ability to reduce the
      expression of morphine dependence.

TI  - Identification and quantitation of ibogaine and an o-demethylated metabolite in
      brain and biological fluids using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
PG  - 427-34
AB  - This report describes a sensitive method for quantitating ibogaine and a single
      major metabolite in biological fluids and brain tissue. We identified the
      metabolite as 12-hydroxy-ibogamine (12-OH-ibogamine or noribogaine) by full-scan,
      electron-impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Ibogaine,
      12-OH-ibogamine, and o-(methyl)-ibogaine-d3 (ibogaine-d3) internal standard were 
      isolated by solvent extraction under basic conditions. The resulting organic
      extract was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was derivatized at room
      temperature with ethyl iodide in the presence of trimethyl anilinium hydroxide in
      dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction was terminated by acidification and washed with 
      organic solvents to remove impurities. The aqueous phase was then alkalinized and
      reextracted. The organic extract was concentrated and analyzed by GC-MS.
      Quantitation was based upon the ratios of the molecular ions at m/z 310 for
      ibogaine, m/z 313 for ibogaine-d3, and m/z 324 for 12-OH-ibogamine ethyl ether.
      The limit of detection was 5 ng/mL for both ibogaine and derivatized
      12-OH-ibogamine, and limits of quantitation were between 5 and 10 ng/mL for all
      matrices tested. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 3-1000 ng/mL or
      ng/g for both analytes.

TI  - Determination of ibogaine and 12-hydroxy-ibogamine in plasma by gas
      chromatography-positive ion chemical ionization-mass spectrometry.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - Ibogaine, an indolamine derivative, is currently being investigated as a
      potential agent in the treatment of stimulant and opiate addiction. We developed 
      a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for the analysis of ibogaine and its
      putative active metabolite, 12-hydroxy-ibogamine (12-OH-ibogamine). This assay
      employs a one-step basic extraction with n-butyl chloride-acetonitrile (4:1),
      followed by derivatization of the metabolite using
      N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide. The derivatized extracts
      were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-positive ion chemical
      ionization-mass spectrometry. The ions monitored were at m/z 311, 314, and 411,
      which correspond to the protonated molecules (MH+) for ibogaine, ibogaine-d3, and
      12-OH-ibogamine.tert-butyldimethylsilyl, respectively. Linear standard curves
      were obtained over the concentration range of 1 0-1 000 ng/mL (average r2, 0.995 
      for ibogaine and 0.992 for 12-OH-ibogamine; n = 3). Limits of quantitation were
      10 ng/mL. The interrun and intrarun coefficients of variation for the assay of
      ibogaine at 25, 100, and 300 ng/mL ranged from 2.9 to 8.8%. We also established
      the extraction and chromatographic conditions to monitor the 12-hydroxylated
      metabolite. A suitable internal standard was not yet obtained so the method could
      only provide semiquantitative information for 12-OH-ibogamine. Chemical stability
      studies of these analytes indicated that ibogaine and 12-OH-ibogamine were stable
      in a human plasma matrix at room temperature for a period of at least 1 week.

TI  - Prior morphine exposure enhances ibogaine antagonism of morphine-induced
      locomotor stimulation.
PG  - 470-5
AB  - Ibogaine is currently being investigated for its potential use as an
      anti-addictive agent. In the present study we sought to determine whether prior
      morphine exposure influences the ability of ibogaine to inhibit morphine-induced 
      locomotor stimulation. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated once a day for 
      1-4 days with morphine (5, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline and then received 
      ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) 5 h after the last morphine pretreatment dose. Compared
      to rats pretreated with saline, rats pretreated with morphine (10, 20 or 30
      mg/kg, i.p.) before ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) showed a significant reduction in
      morphine-induced (5 mg/kg, i.p.) locomotor stimulation when tested 29 h after
      ibogaine administration. Furthermore, this effect was apparent over a range of
      ibogaine (5-60 mg/kg, i.p.) and morphine test (2.5-5 mg/kg, i.p.) dosages. Doses 
      of ibogaine (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) which alone were inactive inhibited
      morphine-induced locomotor activity when rats had been pretreated with morphine. 
      These results, showing that morphine pre-exposure affects ibogaine activity,
      suggest that variable histories of opioid exposure might account for individual
      differences in the efficacy of ibogaine to inhibit opioid addiction.

TI  - Excitotoxic insult due to ibogaine leads to delayed induction of neuronal NOS in 
      Purkinje cells.
PG  - 1611-6
AB  - Ibogaine causes degeneration of Purkinje cells (PKCs), presumably via activation 
      of neurons in the inferior olive leading to release of glutamate at climbing
      fiber terminals. Following ibogaine administration, some Purkinje cells express
      NADPH-diaphorase and neuronal NOS (nNOS), neither of which is present normally in
      these cells. The induction of NOS is delayed in onset, dose-related, and detected
      in neurons adjacent to degenerated PKCs. The results demonstrate that nNOS
      induction can follow excitotoxic neuronal injury or perturbation. However, NO is 
      unlikely to participate in the initial phase of PKC damage. Both the late
      induction of nNOS and the spatial relationship between damaged and
      nNOS-expressing PKCs are consistent with a role for NO in either neuronal
      recovery or delayed cell death following excitotoxic injury.

TI  - Ibogaine and its congeners are sigma 2 receptor-selective ligands with moderate
      affinity.
PG  - R1-3
AB  - Ibogaine (12-methoxyibogamine) exhibited moderate affinity for sigma 2 sites (Ki 
      = 201 nM) and low affinity for sigma 1 sites (Ki = 8554 nM), thus showing 43-fold
      selectivity for sigma 2 receptors. Tabernanthine (13-methoxyibogamine) and
      (+/-)-ibogamine had sigma 2 Ki = 194 nM and 137 nM, respectively. However, they
      showed 3- to 5-fold higher sigma 1 affinity compared to ibogaine, resulting in
      about 14-fold selectivity for sigma 2 sites over sigma 1. A potential ibogaine
      metabolite, O-des-methyl-ibogaine, had markedly reduced sigma 2 affinity relative
      to ibogaine (Ki = 5,226 nM) and also lacked significant affinity for sigma 1
      sites. (+/-)-Coronaridine ((+/-)-18-carbomethoxyibogamine) and harmaline
      (1-methyl-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-beta-carboline) lacked significant affinity for
      either sigma subtype. Thus, sigma 2 receptors could play a role in the actions of
      ibogaine.

TI  - Properties of ibogaine and its principal metabolite (12-hydroxyibogamine) at the 
      MK-801 binding site of the NMDA receptor complex.
PG  - 53-6
AB  - The putative anti-addiction alkaloid ibogaine and its principal metabolite
      12-hydroxyibogamine appear to act at the (+)-5 methyl-10,11,dihydro-5H-
      dibenzo[a,d]cycloheten-5-10-imine maleate (MK-801) binding site in the
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor cation channel. This conclusion is based on 
      findings that both compounds competitively displaced specific [3H]MK-801 binding 
      to membranes from postmortem human caudate and cerebellum and from frog spinal
      cord. Ibogaine was 4-6-fold more potent than its metabolite and both compounds
      were less potent (50-1000-fold) than MK-801 binding to the NMDA receptor. In
      addition, ibogaine (100 microM) and 12-hydroxyibogamine (1 mM) blocked (85-90% of
      control) the ability of NMDA (100 microM, 5 s) to depolarize frog motoneurons in 
      the isolated frog spinal cord. The prevention of NMDA-depolarizations in frog
      motoneurons showed use-dependency and was very similar to the block produced by
      MK-801. In view of the abilities of MK-801 to affect the responses to addictive
      substances in pre-clinical investigations, our results are compatible with the
      idea that the ability of ibogaine and 12-hydroxyibogamine to interrupt
      drug-seeking behavior may, in part, result from their actions at the MK-801
      binding site.

      to assess T-cell regulatory and effector function, B-cell function, macrophage
      function, and natural killer-cell function. The in vitro exposure to either
      ibogaine or harmaline resulted in a dose-related suppression of all immune
      functions examined except macrophage function. This suppression was noted at
      various concentrations in different assays, but was generally only associated
      with high concentrations (10-100 mumol/l).

TI  - Effects of ibogaine on sensory-motor function, activity, and spatial learning in 
      rats.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - Ibogaine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, has been show to reduce
      naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms from morphine. Given the clinical
      possibilities, it is important to determine ibogaine's effects on sensory-motor
      function, activity, learning, and memory. Long-Evans rats injected with doses of 
      20-60 mg/kg of ibogaine displayed slower response times on sensory and
      sensory-motor tests and were impaired in performing specific motor reflexes at
      doses of 40-60 mg/kg. Furthermore, these rats showed a marked reduction in
      locomotor and nonlocomotor activity, as well as emotionality at doses ranging
      from 10-40 mg/kg. At the higher doses the rats appeared to be virtually inactive.
      There were also deficits in learning a spatial location task (a dry-land version 
      of the Morris water-maze). The deficits, however, were probably due to a
      reduction in locomotor activity and reduction in detection of sensory
      information. In a final experiment, a single injection of 40 mg/kg of ibogaine
      had marked deleterious effects on the acquisition of the spatial location task 1 
      but not 7 days after the injection, even though in this case there were no
      effects on sensory motor function 1 or 7 days after the injection. Thus, there
      are severe sensory-motor activity and learning problems while the animal is under
      the influence of ibogaine (acute effect) as well as long-term consequences on
      learning without concomitant changes in sensory-motor function.

TI  - Receptor binding profile suggests multiple mechanisms of action are responsible
      for ibogaine's putative anti-addictive activity.
PG  - 369-76
AB  - The indole alkaloid ibogaine (NIH 10567, Endabuse) is currently being examined
      for its potential utility in the treatment of cocaine and opioid addiction.
      However, a clearly defined molecular mechanism of action for ibogaine's putative 
      anti-addictive properties has not been delineated. Radioligand binding assays
      targeting over 50 distinct neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and select
      second messenger systems were employed to establish a broad in vitro
      pharmacological profile for ibogaine. These studies revealed that ibogaine
      interacted with a wide variety of receptors at concentrations of 1-100 microM.
      These included the mu, delta, kappa, opiate, 5HT2, 5HT3, and muscarinic1 and 2
      receptors, and the dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin uptake sites. In
      addition, ibogaine interacted with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) associated ion
      and sodium ion channels as determined by the inhibition of [3H]MK-801 and
      [3H]bactrachotoxin A 20-alpha-benzoate binding (BTX-B), respectively. This broad 
      spectrum of activity may in part be responsible for ibogaine's putative
      anti-addictive activity.

      receptors (Ki = 3.77 +/- 0.81 microM), less affinity for mu receptors (Ki = 11.04
      +/- 0.66 microM) and no affinity for delta receptors (Ki > 100 microM).
      Noribogaine showed a higher affinity than ibogaine for all of the opioid
      receptors: kappa Ki = 0.96 +/- 0.08 microM, mu Ki = 2.66 +/- 0.62 microM and
      delta Ki = 24.72 +/- 2.26 microM. These data suggest that noribogaine is active
      in vivo and that it may contribute to ibogaine's pharmacological effects.

PG  - 257-61
AB  - The effects of ibogaine (40 and 80 mg/kg, i.p.), an indole alkaloid proposed for 
      the treatment of drug abuse, were determined in three different groups of rats
      responding under an FR10 schedule of food, cocaine or heroin reinforcement.
      Ibogaine (80 mg/kg, i.p.) given 60 min before the start of the session resulted
      in a 97% decrease in the number of ratios completed under the food reinforcement 
      schedule and resulted in a decrease in responding the following day. Neither 40
      mg/kg ibogaine given 60 min prior to the session nor 80 mg/kg given 24 h before
      the session suppressed responding maintained by cocaine infusions (0.33
      mg/infusion). Pretreatment with 80 mg/kg ibogaine either 60 or 90 min prior to
      the session suppressed cocaine self-administration on the day it was administered
      and the longer pretreatment continued to suppress responding for 48 h. Responding
      maintained by heroin (18 micrograms/infusion) was the most sensitive to the
      effects of ibogaine. Both 40 and 80 mg/kg ibogaine resulted in an almost complete
      suppression of responding following a 60-min pretreatment period. Responding
      maintained by heroin returned to control levels the day following the
      administration of ibogaine.

      samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - A sensitive and highly selective analytical chemical method for measuring the
      indole alkaloid ibogaine in biological samples has been developed. The method
      utilizes organic extraction, derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride, and
      detection by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The deuterated analog
      of ibogaine, O-[Cd3]-ibogaine, was synthesized and used as an internal standard
      for the method. Standard curves, constructed from variable amounts of ibogaine
      (50-400 ng) and a fixed amount of internal standard (250 ng) were linear. The
      method has an approximate detection limit of at least 20 ng/mL of tissue extract 
      (180 ng/g tissue), with a coefficient of variation of 8 to 12.5%. Chemical
      stability studies with the method found that aqueous ibogaine solutions (1-10
      mg/mL) could be stored at 10 degrees for up to 7 months with no more than 10%
      loss. The method was also used to measure brain ibogaine levels in rats 1 and 19 
      hr after a single dose of drug (40 mg/kg, i.p.); the results suggest a rapid
      disappearance of the drug after i.p. dosing. The method will help reveal the
      pharmacokinetic properties of this putative anti-addictive agent in animals and
      humans.

TI  - The effect of ibogaine on kappa-opioid- and 5-HT3-induced changes in
      stimulation-evoked dopamine release in vitro from striatum of C57BL/6By mice.
PG  - 587-91
AB  - Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid that has been suggested to have potential efficacy
      for interrupting dependency on stimulant drugs. The kappa-opioid and serotonin
      5-HT3 systems may be involved in the action of ibogaine, related to their
      modulation of dopaminergic transmission. The kappa-opioid agonist U 62066
      attenuated the in vitro stimulation-evoked efflux of tritium label from striatal 
      tissue prelabeled with [3H]dopamine. In mice pretreated with ibogaine.HCI (40
      mg/kg IP given 2 h prior or 2 x 40 mg/kg and animals killed 18 h later), the
      inhibitory effect of U 62066 on stimulation-evoked release of tritium was
      eliminated. The 5-HT3 agonist phenylbiguanide had a biphasic effect on
      stimulation-evoked release of tritium; at 10(-6) M phenylbiguanide,
      stimulation-evoked release was attenuated. At 10(-5) M the basal outflow of
      tritium was increased. Ibogaine pretreatment had no effect on basal or
      stimulation-evoked release in the presence of 10(-6) M phenylbiguanide, but
      increased the stimulation-evoked outflow of tritium in the presence of 10(-5) M
      phenylbiguanide. Cocaine (10(-6) M), a dopamine uptake blocker, increased the
      electrically-evoked release of dopamine; ibogaine pretreatment did not affect the
      enhanced electrically-induced release of [3H]dopamine by in vitro cocaine. The
      effects of ibogaine on the kappa-opioid and 5-HT3 receptors, located
      presynaptically on striatal dopamine terminals, modulating dopamine release may
      partly underlie its putative antiaddictive properties.

TI  - Ibogaine possesses a selective affinity for sigma 2 receptors.
PG  - PL57-62
AB  - The alkaloid ibogaine is potentially useful to reduce craving for several drugs
      of abuse, but its mechanism of action is not known. In the current study, in
      vitro studies were conducted in order to determine the affinity of ibogaine for
      sigma receptors. Our results indicate that ibogaine has a relatively high
      affinity for sigma 2 receptors (Ki = 90.4 and 250 nM) and a significantly lower
      affinity for sigma 1 receptors (Ki = 9310 nM). These data suggest that ibogaine
      may have a higher affinity at sigma 2 receptors than any other known CNS
      receptor. Its low affinity for sigma 1 receptors also suggests that ibogaine may 
      be a suitable lead compound for structure-activity relationship studies aimed at 
      developing sigma 2-selective ligands.

TI  - Identification of a primary metabolite of ibogaine that targets serotonin
      transporters and elevates serotonin.
PG  - PL45-50
AB  - Ibogaine is a hallucinogenic indole with putative efficacy for the treatment of
      cocaine, stimulant and opiate abuse. The purported efficacy of ibogaine following
      single dose administrations has led to the suggestion that a long-acting
      metabolite of ibogaine may explain in part how the drug reduces craving for
      psychostimulants and opiates. We report here that 12-hydroxyibogamine, a primary 
      metabolite of ibogaine, displays high affinity for the 5-HT transporter and
      elevates extracellular 5-HT. In radioligand binding assays, 12-hydroxyibogamine
      was 50-fold more potent at displacing radioligand binding at the 5-HT transporter
      than at the DA transporter. Ibogaine and 12-hydroxyibogamine were equipotent at
      the dopamine transporter. In vivo microdialysis was used to evaluate the acute
      actions of ibogaine and 12-hydroxyibogamine on the levels of DA and 5-HT.
      Administration of 12-hydroxyibogamine produced a marked dose-related elevation of
      extracellular 5-HT. Ibogaine and 12-hydroxyibogamine failed to elevate DA levels 
      in the nucleus accumbens over the dose range tested. The elevation in synaptic
      levels of 5-HT by 12-hydroxyibogamine may heighten mood and attenuate drug
      craving. The effects of the active metabolite on 5-HT transmission may account in
      part for the potential of ibogaine to interrupt drug-seeking behavior in humans.

TI  - High affinity ibogaine binding to a mu opioid agonist site.
PG  - PL315-20
AB  - The naturally occurring indole alkaloid ibogaine is of interest because of its
      reported ability to block drug seeking behavior for extended periods. The
      compound also potentiates morphine-induced analgesia in mice and reduces certain 
      naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal signs in morphine-dependent rats. Although
      these results might suggest ibogaine interaction with opioid receptors, previous 
      receptor binding studies (Brain Res. 571:242-247, 1980) found that ibogaine had a
      Ki value of only 2 microM for the kappa opioid receptor and was virtually
      inactive in blocking mu and delta receptor binding (Ki > 100 microM). The present
      investigation of ibogaine interaction with the mu opioid receptor from mouse
      forebrain labeled with [3H]-naloxone, however, yielded significantly more potent 
      mu opioid Ki values. LIGAND analysis indicated that the data were best fit by a
      two site binding model, with Ki values of about 130 nM and 4 microM, reflecting
      ibogaine recognition of different agonist affinity states of the receptor.
      Inclusion of 100 mM NaCl in the assay to induce the agonist low affinity state of
      the receptor, reduced ibogaine's inhibition of [3H]-naloxone binding. These
      results suggest that ibogaine is an agonist at the mu opioid receptor with a Ki
      value of about 130 nM, potentially explaining ibogaine's antinociceptive effects 
      as well as its reported reduction of opioid withdrawal symptoms and attenuation
      of drug seeking behavior.

TI  - The inhibitory effect of norharman on morphine withdrawal syndrome in rats:
      comparison with ibogaine.
PG  - 117-9
AB  - Norharman (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated
      naloxone (4 mg/kg, i.p.)-precipitated withdrawal syndrome in morphine-dependent
      rats. Several withdrawal signs, such as teeth-chattering, chewing, penile licking
      and diarrhoea, were decreased by both norharman and ibogaine. In addition,
      norharman reduced also the withdrawal grooming and rearing. It is concluded that 
      both norharman and ibogaine are inhibitors of withdrawal syndrome in
      morphine-dependent rats.

TI  - Effect of ibogaine on serotonergic and dopaminergic interactions in striatum from
      mice and rats.
PG  - 1463-6
AB  - The effect of ibogaine (Endabuse, NIH 10567) on serotonin uptake and release, and
      on serotonergic modulation of dopamine release, was measured in striatal tissue
      from rats and mice. Two hours after treatment in vivo with ibogaine (40 mg/kg
      i.p.) the uptake of labeled [3H]serotonin and [3H]dopamine uptake in striatal
      tissue was similar in the ibogaine-treated animal to that in the control. The
      5HT1B agonist CGS-12066A (10(-5) M) had no effect on stimulation-evoked tritium
      release from mouse or rat striatal tissue preloaded with [3H]serotonin; however, 
      it elevated tritium efflux from striatal tissue preloaded with [3H]dopamine. This
      increase was not seen in mice treated with ibogaine 2 or 18 hours previously, or 
      in rats treated 2 hours before. Dopamine autoreceptor responses were not affected
      by ibogaine pretreatment in either mouse or rat striatal tissue; sulpiride
      increased stimulation-evoked release of tritium from tissue preloaded with
      [3H]dopamine. The long-lasting effect of ibogaine on serotonergic functioning, in
      particular, its blocking of the 5HT1B agonist-mediated increase in dopamine
      efflux, may have significance in the mediation of its anti-addictive properties.

TI  - Ibogaine modulates cocaine responses which are altered due to environmental
      habituation: in vivo microvoltammetric and behavioral studies.
PG  - 711-28
AB  - Ibogaine, a serotonergic (5-HTergic) indole alkaloid, was studied for cocaine
      modulatory effects on four parameters of behavior by computerized infrared
      photocell beam detection. The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity
      (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming),
      and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the
      behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and 
      serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
      of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry
      (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/kg IP) for 4 consecutive days.
      Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two
      behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in
      intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber
      (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results
      show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA
      release (p < 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc
      5-HT release (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced
      ambulation (p < 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p < 0.0001). On the
      other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e.,
      rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogaine
      (p < 0.1558) (p < 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not
      significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p < 0.9113)
      although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally.
      Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p < 0.0155).
      Behaviorally, ibogaine appears to be a weak psychostimulant. The data show a
      critical modulatory role for 5-HT in ibogaine-cocaine interactions. Also
      elucidated as critical is the efficacy of ibogaine when the response to (SC)
      cocaine is decreased due to the habituation of the animals to their environment.

PG  - 1517-22
AB  - Coronaridine [1], conoduramine [2], and voacamine [3], three indole alkaloids
      isolated from Peschiera laeta, have been found to enhance the cytotoxic response 
      mediated by vinblastine [4] with multidrug-resistant KB cells. Inhibition of
      vinblastine binding with membrane vesicles isolated from this cell line was also 
      assessed, and the bisindole alkaloids conoduramine [2] and voacamine [3] were
      found to be more potent inhibitory agents than the monomeric alkaloid,
      coronaridine [1]. Thus, these compounds appear to function by binding with
      P-glycoprotein.

TI  - Effects of iboga alkaloids on morphine and cocaine self-administration in rats:
      relationship to tremorigenic effects and to effects on dopamine release in
      nucleus accumbens and striatum.
PG  - 14-22
AB  - Ibogaine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, has been claimed to be effective in
      treating addiction to opioid and stimulant drugs and has been reported to
      decrease morphine and cocaine self-administration in rats. The present study
      sought to determine if other iboga alkaloids, as well as the chemically related
      harmala alkaloid harmaline, would also reduce the intravenous self-administration
      of morphine and cocaine in rats. Because both ibogaine and harmaline induce
      tremors, an effect that may be causally related to neurotoxicity in the
      cerebellar vermis, the temorigenic activities of the other iboga alkaloids were
      assessed. Lastly, in view of the involvement of the dopaminergic mesolimbic
      system in the actions of drugs of abuse, the effects of some of the iboga
      alkaloids on extracellular levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the nucleus 
      accumbens and striatum were determined. All of the tested alkaloids (i.e.,
      ibogaine, tabernanthine, R- and S-coronaridine, R- and S-ibogamine,
      desethylcoronaridine, and harmaline) dose-dependently (2.5-80 mg/kg) decreased
      morphine and cocaine intake in the hour after treatment; decreases in morphine
      and cocaine intake intake were also apparent the day after administration of some
      but not all of these alkaloids (i.e., ibogaine, tabernanthine,
      desethylcoronaridine, and the R-isomers of coronaridine and ibogamine). In some
      rats, there were persistent decreases in morphine or cocaine intake for several
      days after a single injection or after two or three weekly injections of one or
      another of these alkaloids; R-ibogamine produced such effects more consistently
      than any of the other alkaloids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - A preliminary investigation of ibogaine: case reports and recommendations for
      further study.
PG  - 379-85
AB  - A naturally occurring substance, ibogaine, was taken by seven individuals who
      were addicted to opiates. Ibogaine, an alkaloid with psychotropic effects at
      doses of 200-300 mg and above, was taken in single doses of 700-1800 mg by the
      subjects in the study. At the end of the 24-38-hr psychoactive period induced by 
      the drug at these doses, none of the subjects displayed significant opiate
      withdrawal symptoms. At the lowest dose of 700 mg, one subject recontinued his
      drug abuse after 2 days; of the remaining six individuals who took 1,000 mg or
      above, two relapsed after a number of weeks, one reverted to intermittent heroin 
      use, and three appear to have remained drug-free 14 weeks or more after
      undergoing this experimental treatment. Ibogaine may be of value in the present
      and could serve as a model for the development of improved agents for the
      treatment of substance abuse in the future.

AB  - Ibogaine is a putative anti-addictive drug with potential efficacy for the
      treatment of opiate, stimulant, and alcohol abuse. We now report ibogaine is a
      competitive inhibitor (Ki, 1.01 +/- 0.1 microM) of [3H]MK-801 binding to
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor coupled cation channels. Since MK-801 can
      attenuate the development of tolerance to morphine and alcohol as well as
      sensitization to stimulants in preclinical studies, the reported ability of
      ibogaine to modify drug-seeking behavior in man may be attributable to a blockade
      of NMDA receptor coupled cation channels.

TI  - Ibogaine reduces preference for cocaine consumption in C57BL/6By mice.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - After a period of forced exposure to 300 mg/l cocaine HCl in drinking water for a
      period of one week, followed by forced exposure to 200 mg/l cocaine for an
      additional week, male C57BL/6By mice developed a preference for cocaine when
      given a choice of drinking either water or a solution containing cocaine (200
      mg/l). The mean daily intake of cocaine during the choice period was 26 +/- 1
      mg/kg or, when expressed as the ratio of cocaine over total fluid intake,
      represented a cocaine preference of 71 +/- 2%. Administration of ibogaine HCl (40
      mg/kg, two injections 6 h apart) two weeks after the beginning of the choice
      period reduced the cocaine preference for at least five days; the mean daily
      intake of cocaine was reduced by 38% (to 16 +/- 1 mg/kg per day; p < 0.05) and
      cocaine preference was reduced to 41 +/- 2% (cocaine fluid consumption/total
      fluid intake). An acute challenge injection of cocaine (25 mg/kg SC) produced a
      significant increase in cocaine-induced locomotor activity and stereotypy in mice
      previously exposed to cocaine in their drinking water (cocaine choice group).
      Five days after ibogaine administration, locomotor and stereotypy activity were
      significantly lower after a challenge injection of cocaine (25 mg/kg SC). Brain
      levels of cocaine 35 min after the challenge injection of cocaine were
      approximately 25% higher in ibogaine-treated mice (7.2 +/- 0.5 and 9.3 +/- 0.8
      micrograms/g wet wt for water vs. mice treated with water plus ibogaine and 9.3
      +/- 0.2 and 11.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/g wet wt for cocaine drinking vs. cocaine
      drinking plus ibogaine treatment).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Evidence that ibogaine releases dopamine from the cytoplasmic pool in isolated
      mouse striatum.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - We measured the effect of ibogaine on the tritium efflux from isolated mouse
      striatum preloaded with [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA). Ibogaine increased the basal
      tritium outflow in a concentration-dependent manner, but it was without effect on
      electrical stimulation-induced tritium overflow. Separation of the released
      radioactivity after ibogaine administration showed that this drug increased the
      release of [3H]DA and [3H]-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ([3H]DOPAC), but the efflux
      of O-methylated-deaminated metabolites was not changed. The dopamine
      (DA)-releasing effect of ibogaine was reduced by the DA uptake inhibitors cocaine
      and nomifensine. The tritium efflux evoked by ibogaine was not altered by
      omission of Ca2+ from the perfusion buffer or by inhibition of the
      voltage-sensitive Na+ channels with tetrodotoxin. Ibogaine maintained its effect 
      on release from superfused striatum prepared from reserpine-pretreated mice. The 
      ibogaine-induced tritium release measured from mouse striatum that was preloaded 
      with [3H]DA was not affected by the D-2 DA receptor ligands (-)-quinpirole and
      (+/-)-sulpiride, indicating that the ibogaine-induced release is not subject to
      presynaptic autoreceptor regulation. Ibogaine failed to affect [3H]DA uptake and 
      retention in mouse striatum. These data indicate that at the nerve terminal level
      ibogaine releases DA, and the primary source for the release is probably the
      cytoplasmic pool. The DA-releasing effect of ibogaine may have importance in
      mediation of its hallucinogenic action, as seen in a frequent practice in African
      cults.

TI  - Local effects of ibogaine on extracellular levels of dopamine and its metabolites
      in nucleus accumbens and striatum: interactions with D-amphetamine.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - Systemic administration of ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) has been reported to induce 
      both acute (1-3 h) and persistent (19-20 h) changes in extracellular levels of
      dopamine and its metabolites in the nucleus accumbens and striatum. In the
      present study, local administration of ibogaine to the striatum and nucleus
      accumbens produced effects that mimicked both the acute and persistent effects of
      systemic administration: perfusion with high concentrations (200 and 400 microM) 
      of ibogaine mimicked the acute effects (decreased extracellular dopamine levels
      and increased extracellular metabolite levels) whereas perfusion with a low
      concentration (10 microM) of ibogaine mimicked the persistent effects (decreased 
      extracellular levels of DOPAC). These results indicate that ibogaine acts
      directly in brain regions containing dopaminergic nerve terminals and that
      long-lasting effects of systemically administered ibogaine might be mediated by
      persisting low levels of ibogaine. Locally administered ibogaine (10 microM) was 
      also found to enhance the effects of systemically administered D-amphetamine
      (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) on extracellular dopamine levels, and conversely, systemically
      administered ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.; 19 h pretreatment) enhanced the effects of
      locally administered D-amphetamine (1-10 microM). These results indicate that, in
      addition to a metabolic mechanism implicated previously, a pharmacodynamic
      mechanism contributes to the interaction between ibogaine and D-amphetamine. The 
      relevance of such mechanisms to claims regarding ibogaine's anti-addictive
      properties is unclear.

TI  - Comparison of the behavioral effects of ibogaine from three sources: mediation of
      discriminative activity.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - Ibogaine is an alkaloid employed for its hallucinatory properties in West Central
      Africa which has been the subject of alleged efficacy as an aid in the
      interruption and treatment of chemical dependency. The major sources of the
      Schedule I agent are: Sigma Chemical Co., the National Institute on Drug Abuse
      and as NDA International Inc.'s Endabuse. The intent of the present study was to,
      for the first time, train rats to discriminate the interoceptive stimuli produced
      by (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally administered) ibogaine. Once trained, these rats 
      were used to investigate the dose-response effects to ibogaine from each of the
      three suppliers. In addition, stimulus generalization to the dopamine antagonist 
      CGS 10476B, as well as to the serotonergically active compounds fenfluramine,
      TFMPP (1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine, DOI
      (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane), MDMA
      (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), quipazine and LSD, was tested. The results
      indicate that ibogaine is readily discriminable from its vehicle and that
      ibogaine from each of the three supplies produced statistically similar
      discrimination with ED50 values ranging from 2.5 to 3.4 mg/kg. In addition,
      various doses of the novel drugs tested produced, at best, intermediate
      ibogaine-appropriate responding and, thus, no drug tested can be considered to
      generalize to ibogaine-like stimuli. Discussion concerns the multiple actions of 
      ibogaine that have been cited in the scientific literature. The similarity in
      potency of ibogaine from three potential suppliers should allow for pre-clinical 
      work using any of these research samples to be comparable.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of ibogaine on cocaine self-administration in rats.
PG  - 261-5
AB  - In order to determine the potential anti-addictive properties of ibogaine, we
      used the cocaine self-administration model in rats. The results indicate that a
      single injection of ibogaine (40 mg/kg i.p.) produced a significant decrease of
      cocaine intake, which remained unaltered for more than 48 h. Since the half-life 
      time of ibogaine is short, this might suggest the involvement of one or several
      active metabolites of ibogaine in cocaine intake. Repetitive administration of
      ibogaine on three consecutive days also induced a pronounced decrease of cocaine 
      intake. However, a more prominent inhibitory effect on cocaine intake was
      observed in animals treated repeatedly with ibogaine (40 mg/kg i.p.), once each
      week for 3 consecutive weeks. These results indicate that ibogaine or its
      metabolite(s) is a long-lasting interruptor of cocaine dependence, which supports
      similar observations from uncontrolled clinical studies.

TI  - Degeneration of Purkinje cells in parasagittal zones of the cerebellar vermis
      after treatment with ibogaine or harmaline.
PG  - 303-10
AB  - The indole alkaloids ibogaine and harmaline are beta-carboline derivatives that
      cause both hallucinations and tremor. Reports that ibogaine may have potent
      anti-addictive properties have led to initiatives that it be tested for the
      treatment of opiate and cocaine addiction. In this study, ibogaine-treated rats
      were analysed for evidence of neurotoxic effects because human clinical trials of
      ibogaine have been proposed. We recently found that ibogaine induces a marked
      glial reaction in the cerebellum with activated astrocytes and microglia aligned 
      in parasagittal stripes within the vermis. Based on those findings, the present
      study was conducted to investigate whether ibogaine may cause neuronal injury or 
      degeneration. The results demonstrate that, after treatment with ibogaine or
      harmaline, a subset of Purkinje cells in the vermis degenerates. We observed a
      loss of the neuronal proteins microtubule-associated protein 2 and calbindin
      co-extensive with loss of Nissl-stained Purkinje cell bodies. Argyrophilic
      staining of Purkinje cell bodies, dendrites and axons was obtained with the
      Gallyas reduced silver method for degenerating neurons. Degenerating neurons were
      confined to narrow parasagittal stripes within the vermis. We conclude that both 
      ibogaine and harmaline have selective neurotoxic effects which lead to
      degeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar vermis. The longitudinal stripes
      of neuronal damage may be related to the parasagittal organization of the
      olivocerebellar climbing fiber projection. Since these drugs produce sustained
      activation of inferior olivary neurons, we hypothesize that release of an
      excitatory amino acid from climbing fiber synaptic terminals may lead to
      excitotoxic degeneration of Purkinje cells.

TI  - Ibogaine induces glial activation in parasagittal zones of the cerebellum.
PG  - 299-302
AB  - Ibogaine, an indole alkaloid, has been proposed for treatment of drug addiction, 
      yet its mechanism, site of action, and possible neurotoxicity have not been
      determined. Since neuronal injury is known to activate neurologlial cells, we
      investigated potential neurotoxic effects of this drug in rats by examining
      expression of specific glial markers. After treatment with ibogaine (100 mg kg-1 
      i.p.; 1-3 doses), we observed increased cytochemical markers in both microglia
      (OX-6, OX-42, W3/25) and astrocytes (GFAP), associated with striking morphologic 
      changes in these cells. Activated glial cells were restricted to longitudinally
      oriented, parasagittal stripes within the vermis of cerebellar cortex. The
      ibogaine-induced activation of cerebellar glial cells is highly suggestive of
      neuronal degeneration, most likely of Purkinje cells.

TI  - Cocaine discrimination is attenuated by isradipine and CGS 10746B.
PG  - 661-4
AB  - The discriminative stimulus properties of cocaine are thought to be mediated by
      dopaminergic mechanisms that may be modulated by calcium ion influx and/or
      interact with 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors. To test these
      possibilities, rats were trained to discriminate between the stimulus properties 
      of 10.0 mg/kg cocaine and its vehicle in a two-lever, food-motivated operant
      task. Once trained, rats showed a dose-related decrease in discriminative
      performance when tested with lower cocaine doses. An analysis of the
      dose-response curve indicated an ED50 value of 3.04 mg/kg. Pretreatment with the 
      presynaptic dopamine release-inhibiting agent CGS 10746B (20-40 mg/kg) resulted
      in a dose-related decrease in cocaine discrimination with the highest dose
      significantly attenuating cocaine discrimination. Pretreatment with 10-30 mg/kg
      isradipine, a calcium channel blocker, also resulted in a dose-related decrease
      in cocaine discriminative performance. In contrast to these positive results,
      pretreatment with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL 72222 (3.5-7.0 mg/kg), or the
      same doses of ibogaine, did not significantly affect cocaine discrimination. The 
      results suggest that cocaine controls differential responding in a discriminative
      stimulus task by mechanisms that involve presynaptic release of dopamine, which
      may be regulated by neuronal calcium influx through L-type calcium channels.

TI  - Stimulus effects of ibogaine in rats trained with yohimbine, DOM, or LSD.
PG  - 1221-6
AB  - The stimulus effects of ibogaine were compared with those of yohimbine, an alpha 
      2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), a
      5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) agonist, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a
      nonspecific 5-HT agonist. Rats were trained with either yohimbine (6 mg/kg), DOM 
      (0.6 mg/kg), or LSD (0.1 mg/kg) vs. no treatment in a two-lever discrimination
      task. Tests of generalization were then conducted with ibogaine. In
      yohimbine-trained animals, 39.7% of responses following ibogaine (15 mg/kg) were 
      on the drug-appropriate lever, but this response level was not significantly
      different from no treatment-appropriate responding. A response distribution that 
      was significantly different from responding under both drug and no treatment
      training conditions was observed in DOM-trained rats after administration of 15
      mg/kg ibogaine. Pizotyline (BC-105) blocked all DOM-appropriate responding
      produced by ibogaine. In LSD-trained animals, 20 mg/kg ibogaine mimicked LSD.
      Pizotyline blocked LSD-appropriate responding produced by ibogaine in five of six
      animals. The present data suggest the involvement of 5-HT2 receptor activity, and
      the possibility of a 5-HT1A contribution, in the stimulus properties of ibogaine.

TI  - Differential effects of ibogaine pretreatment on brain levels of morphine and
      (+)-amphetamine.
PG  - 173-6
AB  - Previous studies in rats have shown that ibogaine inhibits neurochemical and
      behavioral effects of morphine yet potentiates similar effects of
      (+)-amphetamine. To assess whether these different functional interactions have a
      metabolic basis, brain levels of morphine and (+)-amphetamine were measured by
      gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after ibogaine pretreatment (19 h before
      injection of morphine or (+)-amphetamine). Ibogaine pretreatment had no effect on
      brain morphine levels, either at 30 min or 2 h after morphine injection; however,
      ibogaine significantly increased brain amphetamine levels at 30 min and, to a
      greater extent, at 2 h after (+)-amphetamine injection. These and other data
      suggest that ibogaine irreversibly inhibits an amphetamine-metabolizing enzyme.
      The functional interactions between ibogaine and (+)-amphetamine, but not those
      between ibogaine and morphine, may result from a hepatic drug-drug interaction.

TI  - Interactions of ibogaine and D-amphetamine: in vivo microdialysis and motor
      behavior in rats.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - Ibogaine, an indolalkylamine, has been proposed for use in treating stimulant
      addiction. In the present study we sought to determine if ibogaine had any
      effects on the neurochemical and motor changes induced by D-amphetamine that
      would substantiate the anti-addictive claim. Ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.) injected
      19 h prior to a D-amphetamine challenge (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the
      expected rise in extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum and in the nucleus
      accumbens, as measured by microdialysis in freely moving rats. Using photocell
      activity cages, the same ibogaine pretreatment enhanced the stimulatory motor
      effects induced by a wide range of D-amphetamine doses (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 or 5
      mg/kg, i.p.). These findings suggest that ibogaine might increase the reinforcing
      efficacy of D-amphetamine. However, since high doses of D-amphetamine can be
      aversive, the potentiation of D-amphetamine's effects by ibogaine might also lead
      to a decrease in the reinforcing efficacy of D-amphetamine.

TI  - Effects of ibogaine on acute signs of morphine withdrawal in rats: independence
      from tremor.
PG  - 497-500
AB  - Because of the claim that ibogaine suppresses the symptoms of "narcotic
      withdrawal" in humans, the effect of ibogaine on naltrexone-precipitated
      withdrawal signs in morphine-dependent rats was assessed. Morphine was
      administered subcutaneously through implanted silicone reservoirs for 5 days.
      Ibogaine (20, 40 or 80 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline was administered 30 min prior to
      challenge with naltrexone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and withdrawal signs were counted for
      the following 2 hr. Ibogaine (40 and 80 mg/kg) significantly reduced the
      occurrence of four signs (wet-dog shakes, grooming, teeth chattering and
      diarrhea) during naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal; three other signs (weight
      loss, burying and flinching) were unaffected. Ibogaine induces head and body
      tremors lasting for 2-3 hr and the tremors might have interfered with the
      expression of opioid withdrawal. To examine this issue, another experiment was
      conducted in which ibogaine (40 mg/kg) or saline was administered 4 hr prior to
      challenge with naltrexone. Although there was a complete absence of tremors,
      ibogaine still significantly reduced the occurrence of the same four signs of
      withdrawal.

TI  - Acute and prolonged effects of ibogaine on brain dopamine metabolism and
      morphine-induced locomotor activity in rats.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - Ibogaine, an indolalkylamine, proposed for use in treating opiate and stimulant
      addiction, has been shown to modulate the dopaminergic system acutely and one day
      later. In the present study we sought to systematically determine the effects of 
      ibogaine on the levels of dopamine (DA) and the dopamine metabolites 3,4
      dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in tissue at
      several time points, between 1 h and 1 month post-injection. One hour after
      ibogaine-administration (40 mg/kg i.p.) a 50% decrease in DA along with a 37-100%
      increase in HVA were observed in all 3 brain regions studied: striatum, nucleus
      accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Nineteen hours after ibogaine-administration a
      decrease in DOPAC was seen in the nucleus accumbens and in the striatum. A week
      after administration of ibogaine striatal DOPAC levels were still reduced. A
      month after ibogaine injection there were no significant neurochemical changes in
      any region. We also investigated the effects of ibogaine pretreatment on
      morphine-induced locomotor activity, which is thought to depend on DA release.
      Using photocell activity cages we found that ibogaine pretreatment decreased the 
      stimulatory motor effects induced by a wide range of morphine doses (0.5-20
      mg/kg, i.p.) administered 19 h later; a similar effect was observed when morphine
      (5 mg/kg) was administered a week after ibogaine pretreatment. No significant
      changes in morphine-induced locomotion were seen a month after ibogaine
      pretreatment. The present findings indicate that ibogaine produces both acute and
      delayed effects on the tissue content of DA and its metabolites, and these
      changes coincide with a sustained depression of morphine-induced locomotor
      activity.

PG  - 263-6
AB  - To investigate a possible basis for the proposed anti-addictive property of
      ibogaine, the effects of an ibogaine (40 mg/kg i.p.) pretreatment on in vivo
      neurochemical and motor effects induced by cocaine (20 mg/kg i.p.) were studied. 
      Ibogaine, administered 19 h earlier, potentiated the increase in extracellular
      dopamine levels in striatum and nucleus accumbens as well as the stimulated motor
      activity induced by cocaine. Although high doses of cocaine can become aversive
      by producing an anxiogenic reaction, it is unknown whether the potentiation of
      cocaine's effects by ibogaine would also cause aversion and lead to a decrease in
      cocaine addiction.

TI  - Mechanisms of action of ibogaine and harmaline congeners based on radioligand
      binding studies.
PG  - 242-7
AB  - Assays using radioligands were used to assess the actions of ibogaine and
      harmaline on various receptor types. Ibogaine congeners showed affinity for
      opiate receptors whereas harmaline and harmine did not. The Ki for coronaridine
      was 2.0 microM at mu-opiate receptors. The Kis for coronaridine and tabernanthine
      at the delta-opiate receptors were 8.1 and 3.1 microM, respectively. Ibogaine,
      ibogamine, coronaridine and tabernanthine had Ki values of 2.08, 2.6, 4.3 and
      0.15 microM, respectively, for kappa-opiate receptors. Long-lasting,
      dose-dependent behavioral effects of ibogaine have been reported. The possibility
      that these effects were due to irreversible binding properties of ibogaine at
      kappa-receptors was considered; however, radioligand wash experiments showed a
      rapid recovery of radioligand binding after one wash. A voltage-dependent sodium 
      channel radioligand demonstrated Ki values in the microM range for all drugs
      tested. Using radioligand binding assays and/or 36Cl- uptake studies, no
      interaction of ibogaine or harmaline with the GABA receptor-ionophore was found. 
      The kappa-activity of ibogaine (or an active metabolite) may be responsible for
      its putative anti-addictive properties whereas the tremorigenic properties of
      ibogaine and harmaline may be due to their effects on sodium channels.

TI  - Ibogaine reduces amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation in C57BL/6By mice, but
      stimulates locomotor activity in rats.
PG  - 1003-11
AB  - The effect of ibogaine hydrochloride on locomotor stimulation induced by
      d-amphetamine sulfate was tested in male C57BL/6By mice and in female
      Sprague-Dawley rats. In mice, locomotor stimulation induced by d-amphetamine at 1
      or 5 mg/kg s.c. was reduced by prior administration of one or two injections of
      ibogaine (40 mg/kg), given 2 or 18 hours earlier. This reduction in locomotor
      activity persisted for two days. Locomotor stimulation induced by a higher dose
      (10 mg/kg) of d-amphetamine was not reduced by such prior administration of
      ibogaine. A lower dose of ibogaine (20 mg/kg) did not reduce the subsequent
      locomotor activity induced by d-amphetamine. Ibogaine decreased striatal dopamine
      levels, while d-amphetamine increased them. Ibogaine treatment (2 x 40 mg/kg, 18 
      hours apart) induced a decrease by 30% in the level of striatal dopamine and its 
      metabolites measured in tissue extracts 3 hours after the second ibogaine
      injection. One hour after d-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) administration, the level of
      striatal dopamine increased by 26%. Although the level of striatal dopamine was
      initially lower in the ibogaine-pretreated mice, d-amphetamine (5 mg/kg)
      administration induced an increase in striatal dopamine and its metabolites. The 
      effect of ibogaine seems to be species specific, since in rats pretreated with
      ibogaine 18 hours before d-amphetamine, locomotor stimulation induced by
      d-amphetamine was further increased. In addition, the in vitro electrical-evoked 
      release of [3H]dopamine from striatal tissue was either unchanged or inhibited in
      the presence of d-amphetamine, and after ibogaine pretreatment in vivo, the
      release of tritium in the presence of d-amphetamine was inhibited or stimulated
      in mice and rats, respectively.

TI  - Ibogaine antagonizes cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice.
PG  - 1079-86
AB  - Ibogaine (40 mg/kg i.p.), when given 2 hours before an acute injection of cocaine
      (25 mg/kg s.c.) to C57BL/6 mice, reduced the cocaine-induced locomotor
      stimulation. Such stimulation was also reduced in the ibogaine-treated mice when 
      a second injection of cocaine was given 24 hr later. Thus, the reduction in
      locomotor activity was not just the short-term depression of locomotor activity
      seen after ibogaine administration. When mice were given a daily injection of
      cocaine for 3 days and ibogaine was given after the cocaine injection on day 3,
      and again on day 4, cocaine-induced locomotor activity was reduced three hours
      later on day 4. On days 5 and 9 of the cocaine administration, with no further
      ibogaine treatment ambulatory counts were still lower in the ibogaine-pretreated 
      mice. Locomotor stimulation induced by amphetamine (10 mg/kg) was not affected by
      ibogaine. An acute injection of ibogaine resulted in a transient increase in
      turnover of dopamine, as indicated by the increase in the ratio of metabolites of
      the dopamine to dopamine, followed by a decrease in the metabolites in striatum
      and frontal cortex 24 hr later. In vivo treatment with ibogaine did not affect
      the binding of [3H]WIN 35,248 to the cocaine binding site in striatal tissue
      measured in vitro. In addition, ibogaine added in vitro had a weak affinity to
      the WIN 35,248 binding site (IC50 for cocaine = 120 nM and for ibogaine = 1,500
      nM). The results suggest that ibogaine may have induced a selective change in the
      dopaminergic system that results in a decrease in responsiveness to cocaine that 
      persisted for at least 1 week.

TI  - Effects of ibogaine on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent
      mice.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - In naive mice, ibogaine at a tremorigenic dose (30 mg/kg, ip), did not produce
      antinociception but did potentiate the antinociceptive potency of morphine in the
      tail-flick test. In morphine-dependent mice, ibogaine did not eliminate
      withdrawal symptoms but significantly increased the number of repetitive vertical
      jumps induced by naloxone, whatever the duration of the chronic morphine
      treatment. By comparison, repetitive jumping induced by alpha-napthoxyacetic acid
      (alpha-NOAA), a non-convulsant drug which induced jumping without affecting other
      morphine-withdrawal signs, was not significantly modified by ibogaine. These
      results indicate that while acute antinociceptive effects of morphine are
      modulated by ibogaine, this drug, shown to alleviate opiate dependence in man,
      does not attenuate in mice opioid withdrawal manifestations.

TI  - Interactions between ibogaine, a potential anti-addictive agent, and morphine: an
      in vivo microdialysis study.
PG  - 35-42
AB  - Ibogaine, an indolalkylamine, has been claimed to be effective in abolishing drug
      craving in heroin and cocaine addicts. The present study used in vivo
      microdialysis to determine the effects of ibogaine on extracellular levels of
      dopamine (DA) and its metabolites and the effects of ibogaine pretreatment on
      morphine stimulation of brain DA systems. Acutely, ibogaine (40 mg/kg i.p.)
      decreased extracellular DA levels in the striatum, increased them in the
      prefrontal cortex and had no significant effects in the nucleus accumbens.
      Nineteen hours after ibogaine injection. DA levels were still decreased in the
      striatum and the metabolite levels were lower in all three regions. When injected
      19 h prior to a morphine challenge (5 mg/kg i.p.), ibogaine (40 mg/kg, i.p.)
      prevented the rise in DA levels in all three regions normally observed after a
      morphine injection. A high dose of morphine (30 mg/kg i.p.), administered alone, 
      produced no increase in extracellular DA levels; it is therefore unclear whether 
      ibogaine antagonized or potentiated the effects of the lower dose of morphine.
      Regardless of the nature of this interaction, it appears that ibogaine affects
      brain DA systems for a period of time that exceeds its elimination from the body 
      and, during this time, alters the responses of these systems to morphine.

TI  - Effects and aftereffects of ibogaine on morphine self-administration in rats.
PG  - 341-5
AB  - Ibogaine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, has been claimed to be effective in
      treating addition to opiate and stimulant drugs. As a preclinical test of this
      claim, the present study sought to determine if ibogaine would reduce the
      intravenous self-administration of morphine in rats. Ibogaine dose dependently
      (2.5-80 mg/kg) decreased morphine intake in the hour after ibogaine treatment
      (acute effect) and, to a lesser extent, a day later (aftereffect); while the
      acute effect could be attributed to abnormal motor behavior (whole body tremors),
      the aftereffect occurred at a time when ibogaine should have been entirely
      eliminated from the body and when there was no obvious indication of ibogaine
      exposure. In some rats, there was a persistent decrease in morphine intake for
      several days or weeks after a single injection of ibogaine; other rats began to
      show such persistent changes only after two or three weekly injections whereas a 
      few rats were apparently resistant to prolonged aftereffects. Aftereffects could 
      not be attributed to a conditioned aversion. Although ibogaine also depressed
      responding acutely in rats trained to bar-press for water, there was no evidence 
      of any aftereffect a day or more later; the interaction between ibogaine and
      morphine reinforcement was therefore somewhat specific. Further studies are
      needed to characterize the nature of the ibogaine-morphine interaction as well as
      to determine if ibogaine also affects the self-administration of other drugs.

TI  - Ibogaine fails to reduce naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in the
      morphine-dependent rat.
PG  - 17-9
AB  - Because of anecdotal reports in which ibogaine eliminates opioid withdrawal
      symptoms in humans, we studied this phenomenon in the rat model. Ibogaine (5, 10,
      20 and 40 mg kg-1, s.c.) was administered 15 min before naloxone (0.5 mg kg-1,
      s.c.) in morphine dependent rats (3 days after the s.c. implantation of a 75 mg
      morphine pellet). Of the 12 withdrawal signs scored, the only significant changes
      observed after ibogaine (compared with vehicle control) was a decrease in
      grooming (10 mg kg-1) and an increase in teeth chatter (5 mg kg-1). In spite of
      ibogaine's apparent interaction with several neurotransmitter receptor systems,
      it does not alleviate opioid withdrawal in this animal model at non-tremorigenic 
      (5 and 10 mg kg-1) or tremorigenic (20 and 40 mg kg-1) doses.

AB  - Ibogaine, an indole alkaloid, administered intracerebroventricularly 4-16
      micrograms, attenuated a naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome in chronic
      morphine-dependent rats. It appears that ibogaine has a more consistent effect on
      certain selective withdrawal signs related to the locomotion. This might explain 
      an attenuating effect of ibogaine on some withdrawal signs. However, due to
      complex interaction of ibogaine with serotonin and other neurotransmitter
      systems, the mechanism of ibogaine antiwithdrawal effect remains unknown and
      requires further elucidation.

TI  - Benzodiazepine receptors are involved in tabernanthine-induced tremor: in vitro
      and in vivo evidence.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - Tabernanthine, an indol alkaloid, is structurally related to carbolines (harmane,
      harmaline) which, in vitro, displace specific flunitrazepam binding to brain
      benzodiazepine receptors. In vivo, both tabernanthine and carbolines cause a fine
      general tremor, suggesting that a possible interaction with benzodiazepine
      receptors could be involved in the activity of tabernanthine. This hypothesis was
      validated by the in vitro and in vivo antagonism of benzodiazepine by
      tabernanthine. In vitro, tabernanthine inhibited specific flunitrazepam binding
      in a competitive manner with an affinity (IC50 150 microM) in the same range as
      harmane. Tabernanthine appeared as a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist in a
      discriminant in vitro binding assay. In vivo, the time course of tremorigenic
      activity was related to the tabernanthine concentration in brain (half-life = 2
      h). Moreover, tabernanthine-induced tremor was inhibited reversibly by
      flunitrazepam or by Ro-15 1788 (an antagonist of benzodiazepine-receptors). These
      results suggest that part of the action of tabernanthine may be mediated by an
      interaction at the benzodiazepine receptor level.

TI  - Neocortical rhythmic slow activity during wakefulness and paradoxical sleep in
      rats.
PG  - 160-8
AB  - In the present study, we investigated the different types of neocortical rhythmic
      slow activity (RSA) during wakefulness and paradoxical sleep as well as their
      pharmacological modification. During wakefulness, the high-frequency (7-9 Hz)
      RSA1 type, which is atropine-resistant, is accentuated by forebrain stimulation
      and is abolished by urethane, clonidine and alcuronium. These drugs induce the
      low-frequency (4-6 Hz) RSA2 type that is atropine-sensitive and is activated by
      cholinergic agents and by some drugs such as tabernanthine, ibogaine, vincamine, 
      SL 76.188-MS (10-chloro-hexahydrocanthinone methanesulphonate). The effects of
      pilocarpine and SL 76.188-MS on RSA2 are antagonized by atropine and
      hemicholinium-3, which suggests the involvement of a cholinergic pathway in the
      neocortical RSA activation (as has been demonstrated for the hippocampal RSA).
      During paradoxical sleep, two types of RSA are also observed: RSAT, of low
      frequency (5-7 Hz) present during its tonic components, and RSAp, of high
      frequency (7-9 Hz) which is well correlated with phasic phenomena such as bursts 
      of rapid eye movements generated, or controlled, by cholinergic mechanisms.
      Imipramine reduces phasic phenomena and the periods of neocortical RSAp.
      Alcuronium does not modify RSAp in paradoxical sleep-deprived rats and suppress
      RSA1 during arousal, observations which would suggest that RSAp and RSA1 are
      regulated by two distinct central mechanisms. The EEG studies of neocortical RSA 
      during wakefulness and paradoxical sleep allow the selection and the
      differentiation of pharmacological agents. Furthermore, this approach not only
      may represent a basis for the treatment of deficits in the regulation of
      vigilance and memory, but also a novel strategy for the analysis of RSA type of
      paradoxical sleep with respect to antidepressant and anxiolytic treatment.

TI  - Cytostatic, cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of voacristine, an indole alkaloid in
      wild-type and repair-deficient yeasts.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - Voacristine, an indole alkaloid isolated from the leaves of Ervatamia coronaria
      (Stapf.) (Apocynaceae) has dose-dependent cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on
      cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These inhibitory effects take place only in
      growing cells. Among the different repair-deficient mutants examined, a mutant
      defective in excision-resynthesis repair pathway (rad3-e5) was found to be the
      most sensitive to such a toxic effect. The mutant rad52-1 blocked in the DNA
      strand break repair pathway showed an intermediary sensitivity to the lethal
      effect induced by this indole alkaloid, whereas the mutant defective in the
      mutagenic repair pathway (rad6-1) demonstrated practically the same sensitivity
      as the wild-type strain. The nuclear reversion mutation for the locus lysl-1 was 
      induced by voacristine, whereas the mitochondrial "petite" mutation was not
      induced by this alkaloid. These results indicate that the lesions induced by
      voacristine in vivo are likely to be of the adducts type; such damage is
      repairable in the wild-type; the DNA strand break repair pathway plays a minor
      role in the repair of voacristine-induced lesions.

TI  - Peripheral cardiovascular effects of tabernanthine tartrate in anaesthetized
      rats.
PG  - 60-72
AB  - The peripheral cardiovascular effects of tabernanthine tartrate have been studied
      in anaesthetized rats. Our results confirm that the bradycardic effect of
      tabernanthine is not inhibited by vagotomy, atropine or propranolol. On the
      contrary, bivagotomy, atropine treatment, as well as carotid artery occlusion,
      potentiate the bradycardic effect of tabernanthine. The same is true for its
      hypotensive action and can be explained by the suppression of a compensatory
      mechanism involving the central nervous system, the parasympathetic system and/or
      a baroreflex mechanism. In addition, domperidone and sulpiride, two dopaminolytic
      drugs, are able to potentiate the decrease in heart rate produced by
      tabernanthine. In pithed rat, tabernanthine 1 mg/kg, potentiates the increases in
      systolic blood pressure produced either by norepinephrine or serotonine;
      conversely the systolic blood pressure responses to angiotensin II are
      significantly inhibited by tabernanthine 1 mg/kg. Thus, tabernanthine appears to 
      possess a complex cardiovascular mechanism of action, depending probably on a
      simultaneous stimulation of beta 2-vascular adrenoceptors and alteration of
      cellular movements of calcium. Part of the direct bradycardic effect, as well as 
      the inhibition of the pressor responses of angiotensin II could be explained by a
      calcium antagonist action of the alcaloid.

      isolated vascular and cardiac muscle.
PG  - 35-43
AB  - The Iboga alkaloid tabernanthine (80 microM) non-competitively antagonized
      contractions in both the rat aorta and mesenteric artery induced by cumulative
      additions of noradrenaline and calcium. Tabernanthine (8, 40 and 80 microM)
      antagonized the K+ depolarization-induced contractions of the aorta.
      Tabernanthine (80 microM) depressed the phasic component of contractions induced 
      by a single maximal concentration (10 microM) of noradrenaline in Ca++ -free
      solution. Tabernanthine induced a negative inotropic effect in electrically
      stimulated myocardial tissue and a negative chronotropic effect in the perfused
      rat heart. Tabernanthine is a calcium entry blocker which also affects cellular
      calcium metabolism.

TI  - Evidence for an antagonistic action of tabernanthine on hypoxia-induced changes
      in brain serotonin levels.
PG  - 287-90
AB  - The effects of tabernanthine on serotonin (5-HT) levels were determined in
      several brain areas of rats exposed to various simulated altitudes (1800, 5200,
      7000 m). The 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), was used 
      to dissociate the effects occurring at synthesis and release levels.
      Tabernanthine antagonized the decrease in hypothalamic 5-HT levels induced by a
      7000 m hypoxia and also suppressed the decrease in PCPA-induced depletion
      observed at 5200 and 7000 m in the hypothalamus, the striatum and the rest of the
      brain. It was assumed that tabernanthine stimulates different steps of 5-HT
      metabolism. These effects, revealed by hypoxia, are related to other peripheral
      and central properties of this drug.

TI  - The action of tabernanthine on noradrenaline-stimulated contractions and 45Ca
      movements in rat isolated vascular smooth muscle.
PG  - 251-9
AB  - The iboga alkaloid tabernanthine inhibited depolarization (100 mM K+)-induced
      contractions in aorta and mesenteric arteries in an concentration-dependent
      manner with the respective IC50 values being about 21 and 7 microM. Contractions 
      elicited by noradrenaline in the mesenteric artery were potentiated by lower
      concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 microM) of tabernanthine while they were inhibited by
      higher concentrations (10-100 microM). Tabernanthine produced only inhibition of 
      noradrenaline-elicited responses in aorta and portal vein, the vein being the
      most sensitive of the vessels to the inhibitory effects of the compound. The
      magnitude of the spontaneous contractions of the portal vein, the aortic
      intracellular calcium fraction releasable by noradrenaline and the turnover of
      calcium in unstimulated aorta were enhanced by tabernanthine.
      Depolarization-stimulated 45Ca influx and contractions in the aorta were
      inhibited to a similar extent by tabernanthine and 100 microM virtually abolished
      the 45Ca influx stimulated by noradrenaline and depolarization. It is concluded
      that tabernanthine has a calcium entry blocking action but also has other actions
      related to the turnover of intracellular calcium releasable by noradrenaline.

      effects on tremors induced by oxotremorine, harmine and ibogaine. A comparison
      with prolyl-leucylglycine amide (MIF), anti-Parkinsonian drugs and clonazepam.
PG  - 757-66
AB  - Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), ceruletide (caerulein, CER) and 10 analogues
      of ceruletide, were studied in mice for antagonism of the tremors induced by
      harmine (5 mg/kg, s.c.), ibogaine (20 mg/kg, s.c.) and oxotremorine (0.2 mg/kg,
      s.c.). The following reference drugs were tested for comparison:
      prolyl-leucylglycine amide (MIF), atropine, haloperidol, biperiden,
      ethopropazine, trihexyphenidyl, methixene and clonazepam. All treatments were
      subcutaneous, the antagonists being given 10 min (in some trials 30 min) before
      the tremorogen. Tremorolytic potency (ED50) was calculated from dose-response
      curves. Against the tremors induced by either harmine or ibogaine, CCK-8 and
      ceruletide, as well as many of the analogues of ceruletide had greater
      tremorolytic potency than the reference drugs. Against oxotremorine, however,
      ceruletide and its most potent analogue, Nle8-CER (other analogues were not
      tested) were inactive and MIF showed very little effectiveness. Additional
      experiments on hypothermia and sedation as well as evaluation of previous studies
      on other central actions suggested that the tremorolytic effect of CCK-like
      peptides is independent of other central effects. The CCK-like peptides may play 
      a physiological role in the regulation of extrapyramidal motor activity.

      (author's transl)].
PG  - 441-53
AB  - 1. Tabernanthine produced, in anaesthetized Rat and Dog, bradycardia and
      hypotension which remained after atropine or vagotomy. Bradycardia was
      significant from 0,5-0,8 mg . kg-1. The degree of hypotension depended upon the
      anaesthetic. 2. Effects of tabernanthine on cardiovascular parameters in
      anaesthetized Dog (blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, left ventricular
      pressure, dp/dt, cardiac potency, cardiac work and ventricular ejection volume)
      are described. There were no changes of noradrenaline, acetylcholine, tyramine or
      5-hydroxytryptamine-induced cardiovascular effects by tabernanthine. 3.
      Bradycardia occurred also after per os tabernanthine administration in
      unanaesthetized Dog. 4. Tabernanthine reduced Rat isolated and perfused heart
      frequency. 5. It is suggested that tabernanthine has a direct action on
      myocardial muscle, probably by modification of calcium exchanges.

PG  - 147-54
AB  - The effects upon sleep returning after an effective dose of Tabernanthine
      p-chlorophenoxyacetate (SAD 103) are studied on chronically implanted cats. The
      near-total insomnia lasting for 6-8 h provoked by SAD is characterized by a calm 
      waking period broken by periods of drowsiness. Recuperation follows a
      characteristic pattern: slow-wave sleep first reappears as phasic slow-wave
      sleep, the duration of the phases augmenting greatly between the 12th and 18th
      hour, after which slow-wave sleep reappears. After having been blocked for some
      10 h, paradoxical sleep is seen again, remaining, however, as does slow-wave
      sleep, below normal for the first 30 h. The basic mechanisms behind the
      stimulating effect of SAD 103 are still unknown; hypotheses derived from recent
      neurophysiological and neurochemical investigations on sleep are discussed.

TI  - Effect of tabernanthine on the turnover time of brain catecholamines in normal
      and hypobaric hypoxic rats.
PG  - 119-23
AB  - The central effects of tabernanthine on noradrenaline and dopamine turnover times
      were studied in the hypothalamus, the striatum and the remainder of the brain of 
      normal and hypobaric hypoxic rats, the latter state corresponding to 5,200m
      (410mm Hg) and 7,000m (320mm Hg). Catecholamine cerebral level were not modified 
      by the drug in either instance. At normal atmospheric pressure the catecholamine 
      turnover times were slightly decreased by tabernanthine. Hypobaric hypoxia alone 
      increased noradrenaline and dopamine turnover times by inhibiting
      oxygen-dependent enzymes. Tabernanthine antagonized the effect of hypobaric
      hypoxia especially in dopaminergic areas. Antagonism was complete at 5,200m but
      only partial at 7,000m. This phenomenon may be related to the stimulatory
      properties of the drug.

PG  - 105-12
AB  - Intraperitoneal injections (ip.) of 4 alkaloid derivatives of ibogamine:
      tabernanthine tartrate (2 mg/kg), methoxy-16 ibogaine tartrate (SAD 121 - 3
      mg/kg), methoxy-16 tabernanthine tartrate (SAD 122 - 2 mg/kg), and tabernanthine 
      parachlorophenoxyacetate (SAD 103 - 7 mg/kg), were administered to chronically
      implanted cats. Tabernanthine tartrate and SAD 103 provoke an increase in
      wakefulness level, a reduction in the level of slow wave sleep (SOL) and
      transient blocking of paradoxical sleep (SP). The duration of this action is much
      longer with SAD 103 than with tabernanthine tartrate. The inverse is provoked by 
      SAD 121 and SAD 122, with slight increases in SOL and SP levels. Problems raised 
      by the waking effect of tabernanthine tartrate and SAD 103 are discussed in the
      context of the neurobiology of sleep.

PG  - 1147-50
AB  - On isolated Rat duodenum, ibogaine (70 mumoles/l) increases the hypertonic effect
      following the addition of Calcium ions to the organ previously decalcified.
      Moreover, this alkaloid increases the hypotomic effect resulting from
      decalcification of the normal organs. These actions are taken into account with
      the potentiating effects of ibogaine on noradrenaline and dopamine responses
      observed on rat vas deferens.

      Papiopapio].
PG  - 1190-3
AB  - Harmaline and ibogaine i.v. administration induced in the photosensitive baboon
      restlesness and tremor (8-12 Hz). The former increased the EEG frequency
      particularly in central regions with appearance of bursts at 20-24 c/s and
      blocked by somatic movement. The latter produced a slight enhancement of frontal 
      fast rhythms. Both drugs blocked the spontaneous paroxysmal activity with little 
      effect on photosensitivity. These effects lasted for 2-4 hrs. Vincamine produced 
      agitation during 15 min. post-i.v.-administration and showed an "hypervigilant"
      EEG. Nor vincamine or Hydergine altered the degree of photosensitivity.
      Cerebellar involvement in the action of harmaline and ibogaine is discussed.
